These equations represent a variety of concepts in physics, chemistry, and mathematics that are relevant to computing today. They can be used to model systems, perform calculations, and solve problems in a wide range of applications, from machine learning to quantum computing. By incorporating Quantifactors into these equations, we could potentially gain new insights into the nature of computing and how it relates to the physical world.
(See Quantifactors in computing for more of the details associated with the various physics laws in this section.) In this chapter, we will explore the application of these equations to several different computing technologies which make use of quantum phenomena: hardware architectures for both classical and quantum computing, quantum gates, quantum algorithms, quantum cryptography, quantum sensing, quantum teleportation, quantum error correction, and the quantum search algorithm. We will also show how our results can be used to model the physical process of how quantum phenomena appear and function, allowing researchers to further explore these phenomena through the incorporation of quantifactors as a new modeling tool.

A Quantum Circuit, a Classical Circuit, and a Quantum Gate

There are actually three types of circuits, but for the purpose of conceptual clarity, we will make a distinction. At first, we will discuss the circuit type and its function. The circuit can be a classical circuit (like a classical computer) or a quantum circuit (like a quantum computer), with a classical computer being the same as a classical circuit on paper, but a quantum computer being a quantum circuit with quantum devices such as an quantum gate. A quantum gate is an operation where one or more of the qubits in the circuit change to a lower energy state. The classical logic gates in computers are used to create and manipulate bits, which are the bits in quantum computing.  Quantum bits are the building blocks as well as the quantum information which can perform complex calculations. A single bit or qubit is either one of the lowest energy states or zero energy states. Bits require measurement and a series of operations in order to change their states to either one or zero. A quantum cir
cuit could be used to implement two or more bits that change states as an experiment to calculate a function or perform an operation. A quantum gate can either create a quantum gate in which each of the two or more qubits that make up the gate becomes the control and the other qubits become the target logic states, or create a quantum gate composed of either 2 or 3 qubits or a larger gate. For example, a two-qubit quantum gate can be implemented using three two-qubit circuits and a third qubit for the control and target logic input/outputs.  Quantum gates can be used to perform a gate operation such as a Hadamard gate or to control a quantum system (such as the controlled NOT gate for quantum control).

Quantum gates can play two roles for a quantum computer: storing quantum information and providing a measurement. They can be used to encode quantum information to provide information (measure) as well as to perform a gate operation that transforms quantum information for a measurement. For example, we will describe a qubit that is a logical bit in a two-qubit quantum gate by the state and the measurement operators for the qubit (a logical bit is just two qubits that when in the same state, are equivalent to each other, and therefore can be treated as identical, and an orthogonal basis in two Hilbert spaces is the basis in which to represent a logical bit). The two-qubit state can be represented by a vector of two states for each of the two qubits, and the measurement operator by two vectors each representing a different measurement result. It is the measurement that transforms the qubit state into a measurement result. When we perform a measurement we change the state of the qubit and produce two measurement results.

There are two types of operations that can be performed on a quantum computer: unitary operations that rotate quantum states; and probabilistic operations that can accept probabilistic outcomes instead of a single definitive outcome. The unitary op
eration which applies the probabilistic operation consists in a series of operations using different quantum devices such as a quantum gate or a set of qubits in the circuit. The unitary operation that controls the qubits in a circuit also applies a different operations to the qubits. A particular quantum gate or a quantum gate set uses a particular basis or representation of a qubit that is called the CNOT gate and can be represented as [0⊗0⊗1⊗−1] as it is shown in figure 1. The CNOT gate is defined by the rotation matrix that contains a product of two CNOT gates. CNOT gate is a special type of unitary gate that is defined using a basis that is called CNOT gate basis. There is always only one unitary operation that is used to create a CNOT gate.



For the CNOT gate circuit shown in figure 1, the operation on the qubit 1 is A1 ⊗ B1 then B2 ⊗ −B, where A1 = I and B1 = I⊗−1 and A2 = I and B2 = I⊗−1 and A3 = I and B3 = I and B4 = −I and A5 = −I and B5 = I and B6 = I, so the A1 ⊗ B1 = R6, B2 ⊗ −B = L6, A3 ⊗ B3 = L12 and D5 = –K and B5 ⊗ B6 = L10 which are represented by the CNOT gate basis R6 = I⊗−1L6 = I+1+1I⊗-1. By changing a particular qubit state or a measurement output we can change the outcome of the CNOT gate operation. Therefore the transformation between the CNOT gate basis R6  and the CNOT gate CNOT basis L12  is R6 = −I⊗L6 = I−1+1−1I⊗+1 =+1I⊗-1L12 = −R12.

The operation on qubit 2 is A2 ⊗ B2 then B3 ⊗, where A2 = I and B2 = I⊗−1 and A3 = I, B3 = I⊗−1. Both these qubits, A2 and A3, use the CNOT gate basis C2. The qubit state can be represented in two basis sets as CNOT gate basis C2  which is described by the following CNOT gate matrix L12  shown in figure 2 and C2 = R−2⊗L12  which is shown in figure 3.

The probabilistic operation for a qubit is the operations that accept probabilistic outcomes. To accept a probabilistic outcome, one or more of the qubits of a gat
e must change to a different state,(See Quantifactors in computing for more of the details associated with the various physics laws in this section.) In this chapter, we will explore the application of these equations to several different computing technologies which make use of quantum phenomena: hardware architectures for both classical and quantum computing, quantum gates, quantum algorithms, quantum cryptography, quantum sensing, quantum teleportation, quantum error correction, and the quantum search algorithm.

Quantum bits are the building blocks as well as the quantum information which can perform complex calculations. A single bit or qubit is either one of the lowest energy states or zero energy states. Bits require measurement and a series of operations in order to change their states to either one or zero. A quantum cir
cuit could be used to implement two or more bits that change states as an experiment to calculate a function or perform an operation. A quantum gate can either create a quantum gate in which each of the two or more qubits that make up the gate becomes the control and the other qubits become the target logic states, or create a quantum gate composed of either 2 or 3 qubits or a larger gate. For example, a two-qubit quantum gate can be implemented using three two-qubit circuits and a third qubit for the control and target logic input/outputs.  Quantum gates can be used to perform a gate operation such as a Hadamard gate or to control a quantum system (such as the controlled NOT gate for quantum control).

Quantum gates can play two roles for a quantum computer: storing quantum information and providing a measurement. They can be used to encode quantum information to provide information (measure) as well as to perform a gate operation that transforms quantum information for a measurement. For example, we will describe a qubit that is a logical bit in a two-qubit quantum gate by the state and the measurement operators for the qubit (a logical bit is just two qubits that when in the same state, are equivalent to each other, and therefore can be treated as identical, and an orthogonal basis in two Hilbert spaces is the basis in which to represent a logical bit). The two-qubit state can be represented by a vector of two states for each of the two qubits, and the measurement operator by two vectors each representing a different measurement result. It is the measurement that transforms the qubit state into a measurement result. When we perform a measurement we change the state of the qubit and produce two measurement results.

There are two types of operations that can be performed on a quantum computer: unitary operations that rotate quantum states; and probabilistic operations that can accept probabilistic outcomes instead of a single definitive outcome. The unitary op
eration which applies the probabilistic operation consists in a series of operations using different quantum devices such as a quantum gate or a set of qubits in the circuit. The unitary operation that controls the qubits in a circuit also applies a different operations to the qubits. A particular quantum gate or a quantum gate set uses a particular basis or representation of a qubit that is called the CNOT gate and can be represented as [0⊗0⊗1⊗−1] as it is shown in figure 1. The CNOT gate is defined by the rotation matrix that contains a product of two CNOT gates. CNOT gate is a special type of unitary gate that is defined using a basis that is called CNOT gate basis. There is always only one unitary operation that is used to create a CNOT gate.



For the CNOT gate circuit shown in figure 1, the operation on the qubit 1 is A1 ⊗ B1 then B2 ⊗ −B, where A1 = I and B1 = I⊗−1 and A2 = I and B2 = I⊗−1 and A3 = I and B3 = I and B4 = −I and A5 = −I and B5 = I and B6 = I, so the A1 ⊗ B1 = R6, B2 ⊗ −B = L6, A3 ⊗ B3 = L12 and D5 = –K and B5 ⊗ B6 = L10 which are represented by the CNOT gate basis R6 = I⊗−1L6 = I+1+1I⊗-1. By changing a particular qubit state or a measurement output we can change the outcome of the CNOT gate operation. Therefore the transformation between the CNOT gate basis R6  and the CNOT gate CNOT basis L12  is R6 = −I⊗L6 = I−1+1−1I⊗+1 =+1I⊗-1L12 = −R12.

The operation on qubit 2 is A2 ⊗ B2 then B3 ⊗, where A2 = I and B2 = I⊗−1 and A3 = I, B3 = I⊗−1. Both these qubits, A2 and A3, use the CNOT gate basis C2. The qubit state can be represented in two basis sets as CNOT gate basis C2  which is described by the following CNOT gate matrix L12  shown in figure 2 and C2 = R−2⊗L12  which is shown in figure 3.

The probabilistic operation for a qubit is the operations that accept probabilistic outcomes. To accept a probabilistic outcome, one or more of the qubits of a gat
e must change to a different state,(See Quantifactors in computing for more of the details associated with the various physics laws in this section.) In this chapter, we will explore the application of these equations to several different computing technologies which make use of quantum phenomena: hardware architectures for both classical and quantum computing, quantum gates, quantum algorithms, quantum cryptography, quantum sensing, quantum teleportation, quantum error correction, and the quantum search algorithm. We will also show how our results can be used to model the physical process of how quantum phenomena appear and function, allowing researchers to further explore these phenomena through the incorporation of quantifactors as a new modeling tool. Many of these topics have already been covered by the authors in other popular books like Foundations of Quantum Computer Science (Addai, 1997) or Understanding Quantum Computing (Buhrman, 2017). 



A Quantum Circuit, a Classical Circuit, and a Quantum Gate

There are actually three types of circuits, but for the purpose of conceptual clarity, we will make a distinction. At first, we will discuss the circuit type and its function. The circuit can be a classical circuit (like a classical computer) or a quantum circuit (like a quantum computer), with a classical computer being the same as a classical circuit on paper, but a quantum computer being a quantum circuit with quantum devices such as an quantum gate. A quantum gate is an operation where one or more of the qubits in the circuit change to a lower energy state. The classical logic gates in computers are used to create and manipulate bits, which are the bits in quantum computing.  Quantum bits are the building blocks as well as the quantum information which can perform complex calculations. A single bit or qubit is either one of the lowest energy states or zero energy states. Bits require measurement and a series of operations in order to change their states to either one or zero. A quantum cir
cuit could be used to implement two or more bits that change states as an experiment to calculate a function or perform an operation. A quantum gate can either create a quantum gate in which each of the two or more qubits that make up the gate becomes the control and the other qubits become the target logic states, or create a quantum gate composed of either 2 or 3 qubits or a larger gate. For example, a two-qubit quantum gate can be implemented using three two-qubit circuits and a third qubit for the control and target logic input/outputs.  Quantum gates can be used to perform a gate operation such as a Hadamard gate or to control a quantum system (such as the controlled NOT gate for quantum control).

There is always only one unitary operation that is used to create a CNOT gate.



For the CNOT gate circuit shown in figure 1, the operation on the qubit 1 is A1 ⊗ B1 then B2 ⊗ −B, where A1 = I and B1 = I⊗−1 and A2 = I and B2 = I⊗−1 and A3 = I and B3 = I and B4 = −I and A5 = −I and B5 = I and B6 = I, so the A1 ⊗ B1 = R6, B2 ⊗ −B = L6, A3 ⊗ B3 = L12 and D5 = –K and B5 ⊗ B6 = L10 which are represented by the CNOT gate basis R6 = I⊗−1L6 = I+1+1I⊗-1. By changing a particular qubit state or a measurement output we can change the outcome of the CNOT gate operation. Therefore the transformation between the CNOT gate basis R6  and the CNOT gate CNOT basis L12  is R6 = −I⊗L6 = I−1+1−1I⊗+1 =+1I⊗-1L12 = −R12.

The operation on qubit 2 is A2 ⊗ B2 then B3 ⊗, where A2 = I and B2 = I⊗−1 and A3 = I, B3 = I⊗−1. Both these qubits, A2 and A3, use the CNOT gate basis C2. The qubit state can be represented in two basis sets as CNOT gate basis C2  which is described by the following CNOT gate matrix L12  shown in figure 2 and C2 = R−2⊗L12  which is shown in figure 3.

Quantum Math. The main application that is of interest is Artificial Intelligence (AI). The book Quantifactors in AI will be a good starting point for anyone who is seeking to use Quantum Tools to build more advanced computational models.

What are quantum computing and AI? Quantum computing is the idea that we can use quantum mechanics to perform calculations on our computers. In machine learning, quantum computing is usually used to tackle problems which cannot be solved analytically. AI is a different approach to machine learning, often being used to provide explanations to humans to guide them towards better decisions. AI is often considered as a set of general-purpose algorithms or methods that can be used to solve a large variety of tasks or algorithms. It is considered to be one of the best approaches towards the rapid development of artificial intelligence applications, as computers can process large data sets with relatively few resources and with little programming power. Because AI systems are designed to make decisions, they are also called artificial intelligence (AI). In this chapter, we will show how Quantum Math and Artificial Intelligence can be incorporated into a number of systems to better model the physical processes governing these systems and to study and explain how they work. We will explore how each of the two approaches can be used together to build more advanced models. By incorporating Quantum Math into the equations of the quantum physics literature as discussed in previous chapters, we could potentially gain new insights into the nature of computing. Quantum Math for AI is beyond the scope of this text, but it is a good starting point for anyone interested in incorporating quantum aspects to their software design. We will demonstrate how our model fits together with Quantum Mathematics in many of its sub-models in Chapter 6.

## How does quantum computing work?

The idea of quantum computing is to use the laws of quantum mechanics to
perform calculations on our computers. Quantum mechanics is an emerging science and is currently used to model many physics phenomena, from the basic laws of quantum mechanics to the behavior of particles in matter. Quantum mechanics was originally developed to model the behavior of particles in matter, such as electrons in solids. It has since been used in many other fields such as computation. Quantum mechanics can be used in computing to perform calculations. In particular, Quantum Math is one of many tools often used by computer scientists to manipulate the physical laws of the universe. Quantum computers and quantum physics can both be understood as descriptions of physical laws or physical phenomena.

There are a number of ways in which our computing may use Quantum Math to process the physical laws governing the physical world.

### Quantum computation

Quantum computers are the computer whose states can be changed in such a way that quantum computation. This means a program needs to process data without disturbing the quantum system and can cause it to lose some of its state. Quantum computation is the computer whose states can be changed in such a way that quantum computation. This means a program needs to process data without disturbing the quantum system. As we just discussed, this can be difficult to achieve. To be more precise, however, we can perform quantum mechanics computations on our computers but we cannot predict exactly what the outcome of the computations will be unless we have a quantum computer.

#### Quantum computers

Quantum computers are made by constructing a quantum computer. This means a physical device which exhibits quantum phenomena using the law of Quantum Mechanics. A quantum computer can act both as a single device or as a collection of distinct computers that interact. We can think of a quantum computer as a single device which is simultaneously operating as several devices. As an example, a superconductor acts as two supercondu
ctors which only exchange mass and potentials. A computer that is composed of several separate quantum computers would be a supercomputer that is able to process information in both directions.

### AI systems

There are number of ways in which the physical laws governing our computers could become represented in the machine we use to develop AI systems. For instance, in some AI architectures, our computers will perform calculations using classical computing but the underlying physical systems that the classical system is modeling will be governed by quantum theories. In particular, our computational process will not be the same as that of a classical computer. We can think of this as a quantum change in the classical computation process.

### Quantum systems & quantum methods

There are many types of computation that can be performed by a classical computer and there are also a number of approaches that classical computers use to process information. We can think of classical computing as the process of performing the type of computations that we normally do in daily life. Examples of classical computation include arithmetic operations and data processing using data structures. A classical computer also performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is used to perform other computational tasks as well, for example, we can use a quantum computer to process raw data before performing other computations.

### Quantum systems & quantum methods

In any computational task, there is the possibility of making a mistake. This is often described as a Type II error. This could mean that a calculation will fail to compute the correct answer. For instance, if a function is composed of arithmetic operations and division, the result of the division operation could incorrectly be used as input to the division operation in a further division operation, which in turn could incorrectly be used to calculate other operations in that
same function. Thus a Type II Error occurs in a computational scenario. It is possible to mitigate this error by performing calculations using different operations such as the addition and subtraction operations shown in Figure 6-3. If we need to use both the addition and subtraction operations, we can compute two new operations using the addition operation and then perform another calculation using the subtraction operation. The overall computation can then return a larger answer than the initial division operation.

Figure 6-3. Adding and subtraction

Because Computational errors can become very costly in a computing task, often a computation is performed multiple times before the error can be corrected. To avoid this problem, some techniques have been developed that allow only the first operation to be performed first. This is known as lazy initialization. We can start a computation with an initial state or initialize the system that we are going to use the initial state with the information that we do not really need to store. If this computational task is very big so that our computer will have to spend a significant amount of time to carry out a computation step. For very long computations or long time periods, it is better to create a computational task where we do not need to initialize the state or need to perform a number of operations as soon as we start the computational task. To prevent us from using the lazy initialization techniques, we can consider a computational task to be a type II error if we perform a number of operations as soon as we start the computational task.

Quantum computing is different from other kinds of artificial systems
vernacular for information processing. A quantum gate is a function, which does a quantum operation on qubits at its output and another function which do not change qubits. In quantum computing, a gate performs a quantum operation on a particular quantum device. For example, consider a quantum gate for classical computing shown in Fig. 1. A quantum gate's action is to change a qubit to a lower energy state, and another function that is not shown in Fig. 1, but the effect of this gate on the qubit. This gate is what is known as a quantum operation in quantum computing. A quantum operation performs a quantum operation on an arbitrary number of qubits and some of whose states can be a mixed state or a particular state, a qubit in our example being a mixed state or a particular state of the qubit at the same time. In quantum computers, quantum gates are used to perform algorithms in a number of different ways. A quantum machine (or quantum computer in quantum computing) is a quantum system in which it has the ability to perform quantum computations. Unlike a classical computer computer, a quantum computer (a quantum computer in quantum computing) is not a machine. It is a device, which can be realized in hardware either a circuit, a classical circuit, or a quantum circuit, where a circuit represents a finite-state or computational system. A quantum circuit is a quantum realization of a circuit. The three different kinds of gate in a quantum circuit for a computational system can be defined by one operation, another operation, or a none operation. They can also be defined as a quantum gate, a quantum operation, or no quantum operation, depending on whether the input to the gate is an all-up or all-down qubit. The first kind of gate is what is called a classical or classical-quantum gate while the second is what is called a quantum-classical gate, and the third is what is called a quantum-quantum gate. For our purposes, the latter kind is what we will be concerned with in
this work. As a general definition of classical computation, consider some computational procedure for solving a given problem on the input variable X, a classical procedure which determines X whenever the input is known. This procedure typically works in the finite-state setting, in which we can describe a quantum computer as a quantum circuit with qubits whose initial state can be described by a quantum state which is unknown to the computer but which is known to the quantum computer. In this case, instead of using the usual notation for classical procedures, let A1(X) be the classical procedure which solves the problem. Consider for example a computational procedure like A1(X) which can be represented as two boolean functions of X, Q1(X) = 1 if and only if, A1(X) gives a positive answer. Here we use no operations on qubits with the understanding that A1(X) might make a mistake here or there. If another function, Q2(X) has been computed, then Q2(X) = 0 if Q1(A1(X)) = Q1(X), and otherwise Q2(X) = 1. So if X is represented as 0 on the right-hand side, then Q2(X) = 0, otherwise Q2(X) = 1. Quantum computations are sometimes represented as Boolean functions, which are functions which take as input any qubit state and give a logical value as the output. To explain this, consider the following set of statements that can be written as logical equations: Q1(X) = 1 if A1(X) = 0, Q2(X) = 1 if A1(X) = 1; Q3(X) = 1 if Q1(A1(X)) = Q1(X), Q4(X) = 0 if Q2(A1(X)) = Q2(X), and Q5(X) = 0 if Q3(A1(X)) = Q3(X) The first statement (Q1(X)) is the negation of its negation, which can be written in the Boolean function with the boolean values 0 (true) and 1 (false) as inputs as negation A1(X). The next two have two inputs each: A1(X) = 0 and A1(X) = 1. The first of these corresponds to the negation of A1(X) = 0, which can be written in the Boolean function with the boolean value 1 (true) as its input as negation. The last statement Q4(X) = 0 is also possible, with its boolean value 0 (tru
e) as the input as negation. And finally, Q5(X) = 0, with its boolean value 0 (true) as the input for negation. Quantum computing can be thought of as a special type of Boolean computing where the truth tables for Boolean formulas are used to express the quantum computations which are needed for a computation.

Quantum Computation at a glance

Fig. 1 shows what the most common quantum operations can look like when performed on a quantum system.

The Q1 gates are called quantum gates while the Q2 gates are known as quantum operations in quantum computing. This is actually the difference between quantum gates and quantum operations. Let's talk about what are in fact quantum gates and quantum operations rather than what these operations are at a pure mathematical level. The first kind of operation is a quantum gate. A quantum gate is used to create a state with the same energy value as the input state. For example, consider a quantum gate Q1(X) which can be achieved by the unitary operation for the quantum state as F(A1(X)) as shown in Fig. 3 which is called a quantum gate. The unitary operation changes the state of a quantum state on a first qubit by applying one and only one quantum operation on that first qubit to it, but this can be achieved by any unitary operation on any quantum system. There are different types of quantum gates.

The first general form of a quantum gate is known as a controlled-controlled gate (CCG) or an operation using a controlled-controlled gate (CCG). A specific type of quantum gate called a quantum phase gate is defined by two controlled gates C1(X) and C2(X), with Q1(X) appearing as the third gate, as shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, the controlled gate C1(X) acts on the first qubit and the controlled gate C2(X) acts on the second qubit. These two gates must be simultaneously applied on these two qubits and be made so without introducing any errors in that the state on the first qubit after the action of C1(X) is the same
as the state before the application of C1(X). For example, when applied to x0 in F1, the value of this state should be 0 before applying the CCg1(x0) and 1 after the action of CCg1(x0).

Fig. 2 Controlled gate

The last kind of operation on qubits which is known as a unitary operation or an unitary operation is a unitary operation or a unit
and there is no interaction between the two qubits). This example is abstracted into terms that can be easily understood by general non-physicists.

A quantum mechanical system in a quantum mechanical environment can interact with the environment. Interaction that occurs between quantum particles is either probabilistic or deterministic. In a probabilistic situation, the evolution path of the interacting quantum states does not have any fixed probability of being followed; a quantum measurement or experiment is done in order to determine if an interaction has occurred or it did not. In a deterministic situation, the evolution path is predictable, and there is no need for a measurement for the interaction to occur.

Introduction

Quantum physics is very important for the development of an information technology. Its importance is especially so as a resource for computers. Quantum physics is the description of the physical universe, so in the definition of a computational computer, it must be able to use quantum information. Quantum logic is a quantum physical model for a computer, and the model of quantum information processing is the quantum computer.

Quantum computers that use quantum physics as their model of computation will be very important for the future computers and will eventually replace all computers, thus enabling computers to be used in both the real world and future technologies. One of the purposes of developing a quantum computer in the future is to use quantum physics as the model for the physical universe that computer will be representing a classical computer. A program is a classical computer; in quantum mechanics, a program is usually represented as a superposition of multiple quantum states. If a classical computer (or quantum computation) uses the classical mathematics, it can perform certain classical operations. If quantum physics is used as the model of computations, the classical concepts of logic can not be used in a quantum system beca
use one cannot directly observe the quantum nature of the system that is being represented. Therefore, the quantum algorithms of a classical logic cannot be applied to a quantum world. This implies that quantum computers will require new logic in order to represent and analyze the data that is being processed by a quantum system. Quantum computer are very complex mathematical objects that are not very practical. A typical computer can typically work for only a given time. If a quantum computer is used as a server, it requires very high computing power. A quantum computer will use quantum physics to represent quantum states of quantum objects.

Quantum computer technology is a new technology and therefore has many uses. Some use it in order to store and process quantum states. Other uses are to implement a certain computation that does not use quantum states of quantum objects.

For example, if you have a classical computer, a classical computer is used to perform an operation that performs a non-quantum operation on a quantum system (such as a quantum computer). This operation can be a computation with the use of quantum information (meaning a quantum computer).

The problem with the classical computer is that it simply follows certain classical rules. If it is run to follow certain classical rules that are used, it will never achieve its real purpose of being an analytical tool for doing specific things. Such as a program that will find data stored in a hard drive. If you want to operate on a hard drive that contains data (e.g. operating) on hard drives because you want to find some data, it doesn't make much sense to use a classical computer because such data is in a hard drive; you would need to copy the data inside and get it to your own computer (in a quantum computer the data can be copied to your computer and it will not lose anything). Instead, a quantum computer might use quantum theory to know how to operate on the data so that such operation doesn't lose
any data.

To use the logical operations on quantum data, quantum computers require a quantum logic, instead of a classical logic. This is because if you try to do classical mathematical operations on quantum logic, the result will not be very satisfying. If you try to do classical mathematical computation on quantum logic, that is, on an equation that can be solved with the use of the quantum logic. You will end up with an incorrect value for the answer to the equation on quantum logic.

There is no problem with quantum mechanics in the mathematical model of quantum logical computation because there is no difference between this (quantum logical model) and a traditional classical logical computation model. A traditional (not quantum) logical computation might be to use a single quantum state in order to carry out certain computation. In order to use this computation, I need to prepare and then send a single quantum state to my own quantum computer. Or the quantum state will be prepared (for every computation that will be carried out) by another quantum computer. In order to use a classical computation, I first need to put the required data into my own computers in order to carry out the non-classical (quantum) logical operation. Otherwise the data is being processed at my own end.

So to use quantum logic as a computational model, it is necessary to take into account non-classical events and non-classical data. For example, it is necessary to use a non-classical data in order to calculate the expectation value of an action. One example can be when one wants to calculate the action of the "delete letter" which is "e" by using a quantum computer. There is a non-classical event that must be used if one wants to get an expected result from a classical computational rule; for example, "delete e from the file". In this example, the quantum state is prepared in the quantum computer, and all the "e" should be deleted from database, and then the expected result is calculate
d by using a traditional logic.

However, the problems with classical logic are that every measurement required by a classical computer is in a quantum state for a computation. But in a quantum computer, there is no such thing. So even if you have a classical logic to calculate the expectation value of the action of "delete e from the file," and perform a measurement of the "e" in the system, you will never achieve your true intention.

However, a classical computer might solve a problem by carrying out some operations after a problem occurs, but it does not store these operations and needs to send a quantum "noise" message to its own computation, to allow the computation to complete. If a classical computer stores only the operations itself, such as a classical computer might not realize that it didn't store the correct "noise" message when it was needed from the classical computation that computed it. Therefore, this method is not reliable but might be a possible way of solving a problem in order to minimize some cost.

It is important to note that this is a classical approach that only provides for a classical computation, because classical computation is a limited resource. Furthermore, it is limited to certain aspects of the problem.

In order to use quantum algorithms as their model for a computer, it is necessary to use quantum logic so that quantum information processing can be achieved through use of quantum data. Quantum logic is the model of computation. A quantum computer, on the other hand, is not directly operated on quantum data, it is operated using quantum mechanical interactions with the surrounding environment. There
change a quantum state to a probabilistic outcome. A probabilistic operation is a transformation that accepts probabilistic, as opposed to definitive answers, but produces probabilistic outcomes. The probabl-
ity is given by the probability of the probabilistic outcome; therefore, 0 is considered as being the most likely outcome, but with a probability of 
1 as the least likely (this number is just 1/2).

Figure 1

1 is a representation of a CNOT operation as an operator over two qubits. It is this same representation that is used for the probability calculation. To find the probability of obtaining the state 0 in a CNOT circuit, it is necessary to apply the unitary operation on these two qubits. The basis representation is a representation of a particular CNOT gate using the four basis vectors that all lie on the same line of the CNOT.

It is also possible to perform a quantum operation that changes the probability of the probabilistic outcome. These operations that are often used in the quantum computation process, are probabilistic transformations, which 
allow quantum operations to accept probabilistic outcomes instead of a single definitive outcome. Another name for these operations is quantum gates. Quantum gates are introduced into the circuit by making a series of connections between the quantum devices that change the state of the qubits, usually either quantum gates or qubits in a set. Quantum gate are introduced by making connections between a quantum gate and qubits using the states of those qubits. The connection may be represented in the circuit by the arrows shown in the figure, the state of the qubit is measured and that state's probabilities are used to define the operation that controls the qubits in the circuit. A quantum gate, like a classical or integer gate, is a mapping on an integer number from a set of three inputs that correspond to the two qubits, which then produce a desired output number. We can obtain two quantum gates from a single qu
antum gate; i.e., qubits may be connected together in a set, such as the CNOT gate or two different quantum gates. A quantum gate is a completely deterministic operation involving the measurement results of the qubits, this means that if a certain quantum gate is controlled on a certain measurement outcome the state returned is identical to the initial state of the qubit. In general, a set of quantum gates that are used in a quantum computer can be written out for us, for example the CNOT gate has a set of three input states for the qubits, all possible values that can be obtained from the qubit, and a set of three output states. The quantum gate set is in this representation defined by the basis states for the CNOT gate, and can be represented by [0⊗0⊗1⊗−1], the CNOT gate basis. The basis states for a CNOT gate set are, by definition, represented by the four elements of the set that are located on the same line from the input state. The CNOT gate in the state representation is a set of four vectors; represented by the following two vectors: [0,−1,1], and [−1,1,0], each of which is a one-dimensional representation of the state of a qubit. The connection between the two qubits to form the CNOT gate is a rotation and so each qubit in the circuit has a state that can be defined by rotating that qubit. The set can be represented by [0,−1,1] and [0, 1, 0]. The CNOT gate is represented by the following set of Pauli matrices. They are as shown in the figure.

To calculate the probability of selecting a new state in a CNOT circuit, it is
necessary to make the transformation that transforms the quantum state in the circuit back to the input state of the circuit. 
This is done using the CNOT operation and the change in the probability of the probabilistic outcome. It can be represented by the following matrix whose rows and columns are CNOT gates in the circuit. Each state is one of the four states defined by the matrix. The final state is thus a measurement for each qubit
and this gives the probability of success when using the CNOT gate.

A quantum computer uses controlled-NOT quantum gate set to implement the measurement operations. They must be constructed as shown in the table in figure 2. There are four gates each one is controlled by each of the four basis vectors of the CNOT. To construct each of these gates it takes three qubits: i.e., two from the control set and two from the measurement set. If we put a complete set of CNOT gates in the circuit it can be written as:

The last column represents a set of gates where all of them use the CNOT as the input. The last row represents the gate which takes the new state and uses it as the input for the gates to be added in the control set. The control gates are in the same order as their connections in the circuit, they must be used in the correct order and they must have similar properties and characteristics.

Figure 2

Figure 2

As can be seen from the representation of the controlled-NOT algorithm, to change a quantum state back to the measurement state of the previous step, each gate has to be controlled on the measurement outcome of the previous step; the control operation is the addition. The matrix of the control operation can be written by multiplying the matrix representing the state, and the control matrix that uses the matrix. The column of rows that represents the CNOT gates can be written by multiplying the matrix of the state by the matrix of control gates. This result is the probability of the probabilistic outcome from the previous step of the circuit.

Quantum computation uses probabilistic operations and probabilistic states as part of the quantum operation in a circuit. Quantum gates are applied to the qubits and then the probabilistic outcome is passed into the quantum gates as an input. That state of the probabilistic outcome is then used to control the operation during the time when the quantum operators interact with each other. They act independently and the
same quantum state is transferred in each operation. The probabilistic outcome is an integral number such that the probability of the probabilistic outcome is 1. The two qubit state represents a logical state of a bit; these are the values such as "0" and they represent the state of the qubit at the start of a quantum computer. A probabilistic operation is a series of operations that involve probabilistic outcomes instead of a single definite outcome. This series of operations can accept probability, probabilistic outcomes, and definite outcomes and is called a quantum algorithm. The probabilistic state is also called a quantum state and it represents a qubit state after applying a quantum computation algorithm.

Probability is the amount of probability, a unit integral number such that the probability of the probabilistic outcome is 1. A quantum algorithm is a series of quantum operations which accept probability, probabilistic outcomes, and definite outcomes to form a probabilistic
ight is the state represented by the gat e of the qubit. As a general rule, only one qubit at a time can change to a different state, and for each qubit the probabilistic outcomes of two consecutive operations must be the same. So, the qubits A2 A3 C4 A1 C1, B2 B3 A1 C4 A2, and C3 A3 B4 B1 A1 C5 A3 C1 change from C1 to C4. And thus the probabilistic outcome of the following two operations are the same as those of the first two operations. We will discuss these states more deeply in greater detail later, but for now just remember the final state of the qubit is the state of no change. So, all three operations A2 A3 C4 A1 C1, B2 B3 A1 C4 A2, and C3 A3 B4 B1 A1 C5 A3 C1 will change the state C1 to C4. Which one does not change is called a superposition C1 ⊕⊕ C4 A1 ⊕ C4, A2 A3 C4 A1 C1, B2 B3 A1 C4 A2, and A3 B4 B1 A1 C5 A3 C1. These states are shown here with the black dots. In general, the states represented by the white dots may change or not change by changing one or more of the probabilistic outcomes A2 A3 C4 A1 C1, B2 B3 A1 C4 A2, or C3 A3 B4 B1 A1 C5 A3 C1 and that may be probabilistically determined by the operator matrix L12. So the state shown here is a superposition of different final states. The following table lists these states by the qubits that have changed. The first column is the final state and the second is the probabilistic outcomes for the two cases where the qubit state C1 is changed to C4 and C3, whereas the third column is the superposition of two different states where C4 is changed into C1 and C3. We will discuss two operations for each case. The operations are represented by the following CNOT gate basis C2 C3 L2 L3 A1 A2 A3 (C1 L1 L2 A3 C4 C4 A1 B1 C3 C2) L2 A1 A2 A3 C4 A1 B2 L2 B3 C3 C2 A3 A1 L2 D2 A3 (C4 L1 L2 A3 C3 C4 A1 B2 C3 C2) A1 A1 B1 A2 B2 L2 A1 A1 L3 A2 A2 A3 L3 A2 A3 L2 C2 (C3 L1 L2 A3 C3 C4 A2 B2 C3 C3 D2 B2 C2 A3 A2) A3 A3 B1 A3 B2 C2 L2 A3 A3 L3 A2 B1 L2 A1 A3 C1 A3 L3 A2 A2 (C3 C3 D2 A1 B2 C3 B2 A2 B3 C2 C3 C1 C3) A3 B1 A3 B2
L2 A1 B3 L3 A2 B2 B3 C1 A3 A3 L1 A1 A3 A3 (C3 C3 D2 A2 B3 B2 A1 B2 C3 C3 C1 B2) C2 C1 A2 A3 B4 A1 C4 A3 C2 B1 D2 C4 A2 A1 A4 (C3 C3 D2 A2 B3 B2 C4 A2 B3 D2 C3 C3) B2 A1 B3 A2 B1 C4 A2 A3 B2 L2 C3 A2 A3 B1 C3 A2

For a single qubit A1, we discuss just the first two possible operations. If we have A1 and B1 then A1 ⊗ B1, this is called the single-qubit phase gate, P, which is also an operator. In this case the operation on qubit A1 is P. The operation on B1 is P but we will discuss something more complicated in the next chapter by creating two qubits and combining them. Another more involved method is shown here. And finally we will be able to create one quantum state of two qubits if we do this type of operation on two different qubits. Now we have a single qubit A1, so A1 ⊗ B2, and B2 ⊗ B3, where A1 is a single qubit and so is B3, so A1 = I and B2 = −I. We represent this with the four qubits P, A1, B1 and B2. The four qubits P, A1, B1 B2 are in two different CNOT gate basis P = R−1⊗L where a qubit from the right to the left is represented by an e, (See Quantifactors in computing to learn more of the details associated with the physics laws of this section.) Two qubits of this basis will have the same CNOT gate matrix L12 shown in figure 2, where the four states A1 B12, A1 B11, B1 B12, and B1 B11 are represented by R12, L2, L1 R1, and R, respectively. Two adjacent qubits, (e.g. A1 and B1, have A1⊗B1 ⊕⊕ ⊕⊕ L2 and L2⊗A1 ⊕⊕⊕ A2 in each of the above four qubits and hence they may be represented in CNOT gate basis A1 B1 R12 L
they have two states, and this is how we create, manipulate, and detect logic gates in computer systems. We will define quantum gates (such as Hadamard, and other quantum-mechanical operations where a bit does not become a “0” bit by itself, but that has it’s value depend on the state of all the qubits surrounding it, in a circuit of n bits). We defined circuits, and we can now go on to discuss their quantum counterparts. As discussed earlier, in quantum computation, a quantum circuit is not a single physical device, but a collection of devices made by a quantum computer architecture (which will appear below as an example). So where is a circuit composed of one quantum device and one classical device? The answer is: we build a quantum device, namely a quantum gate, from a quantum circuit that has a quantum gate. In computer systems, a quantum gate can make a quantum computation possible, but it can also create or destroy quantum correlations between different qubits. Quantum correlation exists because a qubit can not only have two states, but more than that, it can also have an entangled state, and these qubits can be entangled because of the quantum mechanical coupling they have to eachother. The quantum gate of a circuit consists of two quantum “layers”, and this may or may not be related in a physical way. You will know that when designing a classical circuit, the “layers” that go in the stack are connected. In a quantum circuit, where a quantum gate operates on qubits that are connected by classical wires, there are also two “layers” connecting the qubits in the quantum gate, with two of the qubits in each layer forming an “entangled layer” in the quantum gate. The quantum gate, or a quantum device, that we used is just a classical device which has an entangled “layer” that performs a classical function. We will see how a circuit composed of a classical quantum device and a quantum gate can be realized on a classical chip. When designing a quantum gate, we will
also consider how classical circuits use quantum devices, as both may also use quantum devices, in that both may construct their gates from a classical circuit and a quantum gate. A circuit that uses a classical circuit made from a quantum circuit and that uses a quantum gate requires that quantum devices are attached to each other in a way that a classical device is not, as is shown in Figure 2. We will now focus on how do we build a realizable classical quantum circuit and where do we need to include a quantum gate, as we discussed earlier in the book, in order to perform a quantum computation that has a quantum device as input. The classical and quantum gates of a circuit can be represented by a classical matrix as shown in Equation 1, where Q1 has an output gate, Q2 has a quantum input gate, and q is the qubit number. In quantum computing, the classical matrix is more complicated than what we have just imagined. There are many other layers on top of Q1, and as we will see, this can be represented in a quantum model through the idea of a quantum circuit as illustrated in Equation 3. In this model Q1 and Q2 are the classical inputs of the quantum gates, while q is the quantum bit number. In Equation 3, Q1 is the superposition of two states, and the two states in the superposition of a classical bit is equivalent to two separate quantum states, so it is referred to as a “state”. Thus in the classical model, superposing two states does not result in one state, and when Q1 and Q2 are set up as a classical circuit, they superpose their initial conditions. The circuit in Fig. 1 is one such quantum circuit, and it also includes a classical circuit in addition to the quantum circuit. In the classical circuit that we modeled, there are two wires going to the quantum gate Q2, which creates two qubits in Q2 that are entangled in one quantum state. Here “q” is a classical bit variable that has two parts. There is an “up” bit which is 0, and there is an “down” bit which is 1
, and these two bits in the superposition of state q are equivalent to two separate bits, as the two parts are interchangeable. When a classical bit is used to represent either of the bits in Q1 in the circuit, we “modify” both the “up” bit and “down” bit to be 1, and when a quantum bit is used, we “modify” qubit q as well. This means that we can represent our circuit on paper as a classical circuit in this case, but quantum circuits such as the one in Fig. 1 use their quantum gates as well. As a result, we must connect Q1 and Q2 in a particular way in a quantum circuit to create a quantum circuit that can make a quantum computation. The classical Q1 and classical Q2 in this case are the classical inputs of the quantum gate quantum Q2 gate, and Q2 uses a quantum gate as its input q. The circuit in Fig. 1 is a quantum quantum circuit, and the quantum gate we modeled here is the quantum gate quantum Q2 gate that has 2 qubits (q) in it. A quantum gate is just a classical device that can perform many different functions, thus we can be sure that it is useful for computing. When we connect Q1 and Q2 in a quantum circuit to create the circuit in Figs 1 and 2, we are connecting a “quantum wire” between Q1 and Q2 in a particular way to connect them, and in the classical circuit, the wire between Q1 and Q1 is not the same as the wire between Q2 and Q2 (the wire that connects Q1 to q has been set up differently in the quantum circuit). In Fig. 1, the wires from Q1 to Q1 and Q1 to q are used to generate these qubits. The quantum wire between q and Q1 in Fig. 1 is used because it is able to make a quantum gate for qubit q, that has the quantum computational power, where the function performed by Q1 is quantum computationally similar to the function performed by a classical “bit” or “pixel”. This same wire in the quantum circuit in Fig. 1 that Q1 uses is also used between Q1 and Q2 as the input of the quantum gate Q2, and this is why it is called “quantum wire”. One quantum wire
, however, can not do the same function, as we will show in Chapter 7. Therefore the wire from Q1 to q (which is “q” in Fig. 1) is called “quantum input wire” and is called “quantum input wire 1” (the wire that connects Q1 to q is called “quantum input wire 2”). There are also classical wires between the classical gates represented in Fig.1 that are used to connect classical circuits in the quantum gates represented in Fig. 2. In quantum circuits, we don’t use the classical wires that we connected in the classical circuits
orthogonal, and are related by the two-qubit Hamiltonian) but we use a quantum system in a three-qubit quantum gate operation as well. It is possible in principle to make a quantum two-qubit gate but the experiment will be much more complicated than before to be useful.

The term quantum computer is sometimes used in place of quantum computer in which a small number of logical qubits can be constructed in a way parallel to a large number of physical qubits. In the past quantum computers have been considered more useful than computers where an entire computer is made from a number of logic elements, but not as general because the number and size of logic elements is limited by the quantum size of each logical element. The classical or physical size of an object can no longer be defined using classical mechanics, and the information that classical logic uses to make things, such as how to define and use the concept of an object, is no longer applicable when considering large numbers of bits. The quantum size of a logical object, however, is a property of the logical element that determines its capabilities. The fact that the size of an electronic qubit can exceed the size of an atomic nucleus makes a quantum computer more useful than a classical one even as a practical approach that should not be used without good reason. An object can have a quantum size that is sufficiently small so as to permit a quantum computer with the same size as a classical quantum computer. To date there has not been any practical quantum computer that fits the description of a quantum computer described above. Some aspects of quantum mechanics are known to be true but for many applications it has been assumed that quantum mechanics is correct so that no serious difficulty exists to use quantum computers for applications that can be handled by quantum mechanics.

Information Storage in a Classical Computer

To fully understand the term quantum computer it requires understanding how informat
ion is used to store quantum information. In a classical computer an object can only use classical information to store information to be manipulated by classical machines. We do not have any physical means for storing information in a classical computer, so that even the information is not stored or manipulated. We do not need the ability to store or manipulate information in a classical computer but information needs to be stored to be retrieved by a machine. Information can be stored in a classical computer and used to retrieve information in a classical machine. One of the best known examples of how information is stored in a classical computer is a single bit counter that the computer can use to count to 1000’s without any external intervention of the computer. If information was stored in the computer it would be lost. But when the information is retrieved by the machine it is accessible to the classically-manipulated machine. Information is information and not information in the classical sense. It cannot be manipulated as information. Information could not be stored in the computer because the information will not be manipulated (because there will be too much information to manipulate to be manipulated). Information cannot be retrieved before it is stored in the computer. A classical computer only manipulates the information that passes through the computer. It only retrieves information that it has already stored or manipulated. It only manipulates information once and then it has to do no longer to manipulate that information. This is why information cannot be stored or retrieved in the classical sense. The concept of information in a classical computer can be thought of abstractly using two words. Information is the information stored as bits in any particular computer, and a binary number is said to be in use when it is being computed using a binary number representation.

Information in a Classical Computer is Used in Manipulation

The manipulation of
information in a classical computer could be thought of using two words. Manipulation is the manipulation, of information, used by a machine to make use of the information that has been stored in a classical computer. If that information was to be manipulated in a classical computer it would have to be manipulated through the use of a machine (which is the manipulation) to perform work on the information. When information is manipulated in a classical computer it is in use, manipulated, or not manipulated. Manipulation of information must be performed, so that manipulation occurs in a classical computer. The information is manipulated only once in a classical computer and then the manipulations of information are removed from the information, except those manipulations that are required to perform calculations that do no actual work on that information, such as calculation of a probability for a binary event. Some information must be manipulated to manipulate that information into use so that the information can be moved and manipulated through a classical machine into a useable form. Information is information and not in use since it cannot be manipulated until it has been manipulated into use in a classical machine. A classical computer uses the information in any form that can change the information into useable form. Classical machines can use classical computer information in many, for example, simple or complex functions. A machine can also change the information into quantum computing information that can be used to manipulate and move information in a quantum computer. Information must always be manipulated to be manipulated in order to manipulate information itself as a classical machine.

Information in Classical Computers and Quantum Computers

A classical computer or a quantum computer does not have information in itself but has information used to manipulate that information. The manipulation of information happens to be used to use the information that
has been stored in the classical computer to perform a manipulation. The information is not manipulated, and because it is used to manipulate the information has not been manipulated since manipulation cannot be performed without manipulation, if the information is manipulated it must be manipulated into use. Information is not information in a classical sense, and a classical computer is not a classical computer in which information is stored since information could not have been manipulated without manipulation. Information as it has been stored in any classical computer has been manipulated. Information manipulation takes place from a classical computer in a classical sense through manipulation of that information in classical computers, but information manipulation is done only in a classical way in which information only manipulates the information it has been manipulated and can manipulate information of a classical computer. Information can be stored in a classical computer, manipulated through the classical manipulation of classical information in the classical computers, and not manipulated in a classical sense in which information is not manipulated in a classical sense, no information is manipulated to be manipulated in a classical sense. Information in a classical computer is information manipulated in a classical sense. Manipulation of information is needed before information is manipulated in a classical sense. Not only is information manipulated in a classical sense (but not manipulation) but classical manipulation of information, in a classical sense, is all needed before manipulation of information can occur in a classical computer. Only information manipulation is needed in order that information can be manipulated in a classical sense and all that is needed in a classical sense to manipulate in a classical sense information are classical manipulation of information (that is manipulation of the information using the classical manipulation of class
ical information). Information manipulation is not needed in order to manipulate the information in a classical sense. Information manipulation does not occur in a classical sense since information manipulation requires manipulation of the information in a classical sense. The classical mechanism for manipulating information exists to manipulate information but not to manipulate information itself. Information that can manipulate information in a classical sense cannot be used in a classical sense since manipulating the information
gate in each basic logic circuit that can be performed in quantum computers. This is one qubit, thus a qubit is treated as a single physical quantum system. We discuss one qubit below and will discuss many qubits above in this article. The state a single qubit 

can be represented as [1⊗1⊗0] in a unitary CNOT gate basis. A unitary operation can be represented as a rotation matrix which is [1⊗1⊗−1] and a measurement operator is also the product of 

matrices called the CNOT gate. This is shown in figure 1. A quantum gate is also defined by a set of operators in a basic logic circuit with each operator represented by a single matrix. The quantum circuits also contains the same types of operator, as it is shown in figure 2.

All the gates that can be used on two qubits are also used on many qubits. Quantum gates are also called quantum algorithms in computer science.

The basic logic gates we will consider in this article have three key components— CNOT gates, Hadamard gates and phase gates.

CNOT gates

A Quantum Gate is a logical operator that can be applied in a Boolean algebra in order to encode information in the logical logic. There are six types of qubits we can encode, which are called the qubits that belong to a quantum computation. It is a logical operation, that allows encoding information in a quantum system. A Boolean algebra consists of a set of relations that hold between elements of a set. The operators of the operators that we call quantum gates can be used to encode information in quantum systems. There are five different types of logical 

operations that we can define for qubits in a quantum computation. CNOT gates are one types of qubits and are defined by the operator that rotates a single qubit. It is the most basic and fundamental logic gates that we can use to control the logic of the computer we are going to make. CNOT gate is represented by C in the figure 1. The product of a CNOT and the product of a CNOT are a CNOT gate. All the operation
s that hold a logic in a Boolean algebra can also be used to control the logic in a circuit of logic gates. The CNOT gates are also called the quantum gates and are also represented by the operators in figure 1. The CNOT gate contains three input-output relations, the OR relation, as an input and the NOT to represent the two output in the 

figure 1 (image taken from D. V. Skokos, Quantum Computations by Means of the Not and the Or Gates of Quantum Gates)

OR relation. Every other logical operator is contained in its own Boolean algebra and the gates of which are represented by some operators that contain the input. The qubits of a quantum computer in which the different gates are defined in the Boolean Algebra can be defined as 1 bit-level representation of a qubit, and it can also be represented as a 1 bit-level representation in a more complicated logic and quantum hardware.

CNOT gate operation

CNOT gate is one of the most basic gates used in quantum computers. It means that the state of the gate is transformed by a CNOT gate on the qubit. It transforms the state of the qubit into two different states. This transformation can be represented as a matrix. A CNOT gate operation is a series of operations in a circuit, which are written in the order of the order of operations in quantum hardware.

The first operation of the CNOT operation is a unitary operation, and it is [0⊗0⊗1⊗−1] represented by the matrix as shown in figure 1. There are two parameters, where each of them are the CNOT gate. Thus it can be written as [0⊗0⊗1⊗−1] in a three-dimensional phase space. By doing this we transform all of the operations of the CNOT gate into simple transformations of the phase space of the qubit. In general we can transform as X ↾Y where X is a unitary operation, or X ↾Y → Z,Y where Z is a unitary operation and Y 

is a constant vector. Thus this transformation has six possible outputs, with the X ↾Y part being an X ↾+1 part, the X ↾Y part being an X ↾-1 part and the Y ↾Z p
art being a Y ↾+1 part or Y ↾-1 part

When the state after the transformation is represented as [1⊗1⊗0] and the input qubit as C-1-1 the output of the CNOT gate is [0⊗0⊗1⊗0]. An operation that has a constant output is a constant transformation. This transformation can be represented as a unitary matrix U in the 3-dimensional phase space, the product of a unitary operator, X ↾ = X =

, where X is a unitary operation.

The other two operations are represented by the matrix X ↾X. The first input qubit is represented as 1-1, and the second as C-1-1. The two outputs, that we represent as X ↾+C-1-1 and X ↾-C+1-1 are represented by 

. Thus in the phase space, the output of [0⊗0⊗1⊗0] is an output of 

. By doing this transformation on the phase space, we obtain a logical operation -1. The first operation of the CNOT gate on the qubit is represented by the first X ↾+1, thus the operation is represented by [0⊗0⊗1⊗0] which can be transformed to a matrix of the form [0⊗0⊗1⊗1] by the unitary operation 

, where the first X ↾+1 represents the 1-output of the CNOT gate. By doing this we can convert a logical operation to either 0 or 1.

The other CNOT gate, represented by the second X ↾-1, is the second X ↾+1 operation. It can be represented as [−1⊗−1⊗1]. Using this transformation, we convert a logical operation to the NOT operation which is represented by ±1.

The other two operations are represented by the second X ↾+1 and the two outputs, that we represent as X ↾-1. The first output of the CNOT gate we have [−1⊗+1⊗1], which can be written as [−1⊗−1⊗+] if we transform it to a matrix where the first output of the first X ↾+1 operation is represented by [−1⊗−
its state to a particular state from the two different basis states.

The basis used by the operator to perform the operation on the qubit changes based on the outcome of the measurement of the Qubit 2 or Qubit 3. If the operator finds that Qubit 2's measurement outcomes is 1−1, B2 = I = B3 so the CNOT gate is R6 = I−1⊗L6 = I+1+−1I⊗−1 = +I⊗−1L12 = −R12. If the operator finds that Qubit 2's measurement outcomes is 0, B11 = I = B12, so the CNOT gate is R6 = I⊗−1⊗L6 = I−1+1−1I⊗+1 = +I⊗−1L12 = −R12, and if the operator finds that Qubit 2's measurement outcomes is 1, B11 = I = B22 so the CNOT gate is R6 = I−1⊗L6 = I+1±1I⊗+1 = +I⊗−1L12 = −R12. In either case the CNOT gate is represented by the matrix L12 shown in figure 2 and C2 = R−2⊗L12 is shown in figure 3.

The CNOT gate is a basic operation in quantum computing and is the core quantum logic gate in quantum computers by itself. It is one of the fundamental operations being used in the emerging quantum computer computing in the next few years. The operation of CNOT gate is also called as quantum Fourier transform or quantum amplitude modulation

2.3 The quantum Fourier transform(QFT) is a transform that calculates in quantum mechanics through the wave function. It was first used to calculate electronic properties in quantum mechanics. This is done by applying two sine waves with different frequencies or phase to a qubit to determine the energy eigenvalue. It has been used in quantum computing as the Fourier transform in the process to determine the information in various quantum computers and quantum algorithms.

2.4 The second level quantum Fourier transform is based on the quantum Fourier transform of phase shift based on the same qubit state as the quantum Fourier transform. This form is represented by the CNOT gate C2 as shown in Figure 4. Again the operation can be represented by A2 ⊗ B3 = R6, B4 ⊗ B5 = L6 and A5 ⊗ B6 = L10.

2.5 Here the application of the phase shift transform is given on A3 ⊗ B3 = L6 and A5 ⊗ B6 = L10. This form of CNOT gate basis is not yet implemented in a physical setting. This process has a limitation on the time constant, t2, due to the exponential relationship of t2 and the time-scale in generating CNOT gate basis. The exponential relationship is exponential and t2 is exponential in the time variable and proportional to the exponential of time, t, of the pulse train used in the gate circuit. This exponential relationship is present in all implementations of a quantum computer and there is no physical or mathematical form for exponential relationship. It is important to note that in quantum mechanics there is a form for the exponential relationship such as this:

2.6 There have no formal mathematical or physical relationship for an exponential transformation such as this.

2.7 The two-level quantum Fourier transform CNOT gate C2 requires a complex measurement process, a superposition of two states, and a measurement. All of these are necessary for the implementation of the quantum Fourier transform. The superposition of two states can be represented by one qubit state by using the CNOT gate matrix L10 shown in Figure 5. The measurement process can be represented on Qubit 1 = +1 and Qubit 3 = 1-1. After the measurement process, the qubit 2 has a new eigenstate to represent the qubit 2 basis state. Therefore the CNOT gate basis R6 = A5 and C2 = I−2⊗L12

Figure: Qubit state from C2 to R6 is R6 from A5 to I-2⊗L is A5 = A5 + A5′ I−⊗L12= 2⊗I-2⊗L12= R6 = R−2⊗L12 The quantum Fourier transform using the CNOT gate C2 matrix elements needs the qubit states superposition and this is a limitation inherent with the qubit states quantum fourier transforms in that they are limited to a single basis and a single frequency. However, all implementations of quantum computers also require the qubit states superposition, even quantum computers without a physical imple
mentation. Furthermore, for quantum computers the qubit state and frequency are represented on the basis of the quantum computer implementation, and this is the essential aspect of the quantum computer construction. However, this limitation can be overcome by the implementation of two-level quantum Fourier transform gates.

photons, electron spins, or quantum dots in silicon. Qubits are just like classical bits but are at an extremely higher level of information and quantum mechanical behavior. When the qubits change, the new quantum bits also change, and this creates a whole new computational system, which is now quantum.

1.1 Circuit Types: Classical Circuit Analog to a Classical Computer

Let’s say this happens in our quantum computing program:

It’s actually a quantum circuit, but not a quantum computation because our “bits” do not actually have a physical qubit as we said earlier. Instead, they have the classical analog of a qubit. So they are a sort of a digital analog of the classical logic gates that we talked about earlier: AND, OR, XOR, NOT and NOT-XOR (Xor) which is NOT. Or they can be a quantum gate in which there is no qubit change, but instead they have this gate, which will be a quantum gate because it has a different qubit state.

It would be like a classical computer with a quantum gate between your inputs and outputs or in this case between your qubits. These gates are the analogs of the classical gates they connect, in particular NOT, NOT-XOR, AND, and OR. In classical computers, those inputs are in input and those outputs are in output. In quantum computing, you would have some input qubits which can pass through some gates to some outputs that can only go through gates to some input qubits and in that sense it is more like a logic gate which takes the logic of the problem and passes the result of that problem to the next level of the computational problem. Now this is very similar to how classical computers work except it is more mathematical than a purely physical thing because there are logical equations, which is why the output is not physical.

In computer science the concept of quantum computation would be an analog of what is called quantum annealing, where instead of just trying to maximize the amount of energy, the goal of the computation is to minimize th
e energy. The physics are kind of more complicated, but in this particular problem the goal is to minimize the time, or not use energy, to solve it by quantum annealing.

2.1 Quantum Gate Analogies between Classical Computation and Quantum Computation

Now let’s look at the other two elements in a quantum circuit (quantum gates): the quantum gates and the quantum gates. The two are different, but the same operation.

Say that we have some quantum gate such as the NOT or the QXOR of NOT and XOR.

This is called a quantum gate.

Now let’s look at the QXOR. We know NOT(AOR(BORC), or AOR(B), COR(BORC) is a NOT, but the name actually refers to the operation aor. A and B have a property called qubits which are like classical bits. A QBIT is kind of a quantum bit. What we are talking about is if a given quantum gate is applied to a qubit (or if any logic gate is applied to a state), then the state changes.

For example, say we do NOT(AOR(BORC), AOR(B), COR(BORC) is to be translated into the state AOR(B)).

Now in this case A is a classical bit, and in this context, this aor (NOT) will actually be able to change a bit into the opposite direction, something that is easy to forget and will not affect the logical output of the circuit.

This is a function that applies to our QBIT when it is applied on this QBIT, and it only acts on qubits, but not on classical bits. It will be very familiar to anybody that has even some exposure to quantum mechanics.

The QXOR is also similar to the NOT for qubits because when we make a NOT or QXOR, we will change a qubit by moving the state of a QBIT. What is important is that it acts on just qubits without changing classical bits. When these gates are applied on two qubits, this will change their state only, but NOT(AOR(BORC), AOR(B), COR(BORC) can change a NOT from a to a OR and from that into AOR. A logical OR, when the circuit is applied on that, can be represented as 2a. QXOR. When this is inverted, which is represented as 2b, then QXOR
will be the result.

3.1 Quantum Gate Analogies between Classical and Quantum Computation

We saw previously in the preceding section that every QV between a QBIT and a classical output or input, a logical AND or OR or NOT, depending on whether the QBIT state is a QBIT or a simple integer. For our purposes in quantum computing, that means that every single logical function will be a QFunction.

Every single QFunction will have an associated quantum gate.

Any single quantum gate will have an associated quantum gate.

Now the only difference between quantum and traditional computing (i.e., the computation that occurs on classical computers) in the previous section was the classical gates that we had in the computer being converted into digital devices. Now, a quantum gate has a single, independent classical gate input into it and an independent output. So they might resemble classical gates in the way that we made logical function of them.

If a given QV was created using two classical gates, then they would be a classical circuit with two inputs and two output gates.

So a given circuit has the same logical behavior no matter how you are representing the behavior in different ways.

Any given quantum gate could be represented as a classical gate.

If a given QV could be represented using just a single classical gate input, then it is called a classical quantum gate. Any quantum gate might be represented as a quantum circuit with two inputs and two outputs. So, if a given QV has an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs, then it is called a quantum circuit.

There is nothing special about these input and output gates when they are represented as classical logic gates that can create a QFunction using only logic gates or logical functions.

If a given QV has multiple inputs and outputs, then the input and output gates may be represented as both classical or quantum gate inputs and outputs or both classical gate inputs and outputs. So it might look something like this:
4.1 A Mathematical Representation of the Quantum Gate State

We talked about classical gates being like digital devices or classical gates being the analogs of quantum gates at the level of logical functions.

With a quantum computation, we can break that down into two separate bits. We want to take that to another level. We want to break down a quantum gate into two states, or qubits. We have a single qubit where one qubit is a classical bit which acts like a bit in classical logic, but now we want to represent that qubit as a quantum bit, which has two different states.

First, we have the quantum state,
state the logical bit is either in one of the states 0 or 1). We will also write down a quantum circuit that can implement the Hadamard gate for two qubits using the logical gates.

the idea of quantum computer as a quantum memory that can perform calculations for data processing. Quantum computers have been around for about forty years, and the ability to store a quantum state and to store quantum information has been demonstrated. However, to perform calculations on the size of supercomputers, quantum computers require very high precision logic gates. This precision is what makes the calculations so complex. Quantum logic is the combination of quantum gates to create quantum information that can be used to calculate a function on the two-qubit quantum-mechanical system. Quantum computers can only carry out one calculations at a time because quantum information cannot be stored in a quantum memory in a logical state. The complexity of any calculation using quantum information creates the challenge for the quantum computation.

The goal of our work in quantum computing is to demonstrate the quantum memory effects in this area. Quantum computing is not only to provide information, but also to have the ability to process it later after storing it. Quantum memory effect in quantum computation allows quantum information to be stored in a quantum state for subsequent processing. In an experiment of the type that we have in mind, one should have a qubit which can store quantum information and another qubit that has an operation to perform for quantum information. This second qubit will be read from, the other qubit stored in it. The operation performed by this second qubit determines the result of the computation, thus the whole two qubit quantum process is used to represent one function. In this experiment we will use the logical operators, and the measurement and measurement probabilities to implement a logical function.

the quantum circuits that implement the logical
functions can be written down in the form of a quantum circuit. The quantum circuit contains 2-bit, one-qubit, and two-qubit logical gates. For a single logical qubit we have the AND and NOT gates and a gate which can either flip up or down the state of a single qubit. For a two-qubit quantum gate we have the XOR gate, and we can make a single qubit operation by flipping up states of either one qubit or down states of the other qubit which flip the state accordingly. Note that the AND and NOT gates act to produce the logical bit value of one if the state of either logical qubit is zero and zero otherwise. In this work we implement a 2-qubit quantum gate that performs the logical operation. The physical implementation is a two qubit quantum circuit.

the measurement process is the process where a quantum state is measured, and a measurement result is measured or recorded by a measurement apparatus. In quantum computation, qubits can be measured to perform quantum operations. There are many ways, but we will use the following basic measurement techniques which we will explore in the work.

There are two main measurement techniques that exist to perform a measurement on a quantum system. One is the projection measurement. This is the simplest measurement, which measures the state of the quantum system by simply sending a probe particle (or a photon) through the interaction region. The other is the projective measurement. This has two parts: a control measurement and the measurement. A projective measurement is the measurement of the state of a quantum system. A control measurement must first be performed and then a second measurement is performed on the system, and then the control measurement and measurement are combined. A general scheme of the projective measurement is shown in the figure (Figure 1).

The projection qubit measurements are represented by a projective measurement in a two-qubit system (Figure 1), where the two qubits are in the logical zero state. As
shown in Figure 1, the measurement for the two logical qubits is a control measurement. For each qubit, only the qubit with the logical "0" is measured. The logical operation is then performed on the qubit with the logical "0". The state of the logical "0" after the logical operation is then revealed. As shown in Figure 1, A and B respectively denote a control measurement and measurement in the two logical qubits.

The projective measurement is one of the approaches used to implement the quantum gate. The idea is to perform a control measurement and project on a certain value/direction of the electron (quantum state) so that subsequent operations can be performed. The control measurement can be done with a control measurement on each logical qubit, or alternatively, on all three logical qubits. Using the measurement and a quantum gate one can perform a unitary (controlled) operation on a quantum system. The measurement, as shown in Fig 2, is performed on one logical qubit. If the state of the quantum system is 0, we record that there is no control information associated with the measurement. This can be used to make a measurement for a control qubit. We then send a photon through the interaction region. If its path is parallel to the qubit in the logical "0" state, we send a photon through the measurement aperture. If the path of the photon is orthogonal to the logical operation, we record the information of the measurement state at the output of the measurement apparatus. In each case of a measurement we obtain the recorded measurement result. For example, the measurement results given the measurement of the logical "0" are 0 for A and 1 for B.

Figure 2 The measurement for the 2-qubit quantum unitary operation can be made using a projective measurement.

the measurement device that can detect the result of the measurement of the two qubits and measure the resulting logical state for the two qubits. The measurement device includes four measurement devices (two for
each of the two logical qubits), which each have three inputs of the photon to be sent from the measurement apparatus through the interaction region. If the state of the quantum system is 0 or 1, the incoming photon is in parallel transport to the measurement device where a control measurement is performed on the logical qubit, with the control measurement result being recorded. If the state of the quantum system is in an unknown state, the measurement device records the state of the quantum system. The measurement device has two outputs: the measurement result, and the control information.

Let us consider the logical operation that is a logical AND of the states of the two logical qubits. This will be the basis for performing the logical unitary operation on qubits. We will use a logical AND operation to implement a two-qubit logical operation.

The logical AND operation of two qubits is accomplished by the measurement of the first qubit and the measurement of the second qubit, as shown in Figure 3. In every measurement result we will get the logical "1" or the logical "0". (Because of the logical operations, we can use the measurement results as the target of the next logical AND operation.)

Figure 3 The logical AND operation is made with a control measurement and two measurements (a control measurement of the first qubit and a measurement of the second qubit).

A logical AND operation is a quantum operation, and a state with
qubits in the gate set that apply one operation to a qubit, and  qubits in the gate set that apply another operation to a qubit.

In quantum computers the state of the register that contains the quantum states of all the qubits will not have another basis. Because of this, the computation of a physical algorithm can only consist in transforming or sorting a superposition of these states, called the quantum superposition.

Computing
The problem of computing cannot be solved in principle using a classical computer, a device that can produce definitive outcomes directly. This is because quantum theory states that information should be measured as a function of time, which must be treated as a continuous variable in order to compute computations.

Quantum computing

Physical computer 
Quantum computers (also known as quantum information, quantum computation, or quantum computation) have the same physical structure as classical computers, but they use quantum particles to control the computer’s behavior and work directly without the use of central computing devices such as a central processing unit, a computer’s hard drive, or a keyboard, as in the classical machine. These quantum particles include individual qubits and quantum bits, which are just logical information (bits), and the individual units of the quantum computer are called quantum processors. There are various physical approaches of building a quantum computer.

One approach is to use physical gates, called quantum gates, to manipulate the state of quantum systems. A quantum gate is a set of operations that allows a specific quantum system, such as the quantum annealer, a quantum computer, or a quantum gate set, that can perform one or more quantum operations at a time. The specific set of quantum gates or gate sets that are used to build a quantum computer are defined by the mathematical properties of the set in question. For example, in a quantum-logic processor based on the concept of quantum gates, a sup
erposition of the states {0,1} of qubits has a value of one only if and only if that quantum gate is applied. Such quantum operations are called quantum gates and the quantum gates they define are the quantum gates.

To use quantum computers, a classical bit called a 'digital input' is encoded in a 1 or 0 ( binary representation). The classical bit can thus be viewed as being in a superposition of a value ‘1’, represented by '0', and a value ‘0’, represented by ‘1’. The computational problem of computing the ‘0’ and the ‘1’ are equivalent. Computations in quantum computers can be represented and manipulated with different quantum operations depending if the quantum operations are performed individually or performed in a quantum gate set. Such quantum operations are called quantum gates and the quantum gates they define are the quantum gates. The quantum circuits are also defined by the mathematical properties of the quantum gates they define in quantum quantum computsions such as for example the quantum CNOT gate.

Optimisation
One major aim of quantum computers is to develop methods for designing quantum circuits that are so simple that they are computationally unfeasible for a classical computer. The computational complexity of a problem is the length of a shortest unitary quantum gate algorithm.

Many quantum circuits are optimised for some number of operations (e.g., 4 or 5), where a larger circuit is the larger the set of quantum gates that can be implemented on it. Optimal quantum circuit depth is the maximum size of the unit quantum gates that can be implemented. In practice, the circuit depth is not optimized due to limitations on the number of quantum gates that can be implemented on a given computer. An alternative measure of the circuit depth is called circuit depth complexity and the circuit depth is the least number of quantum gates used to complete a circuit. A circuit depth computation can then be used as an efficient measure of the computational comp
lexity. The advantage with using the circuit depth as the measure of complexity is that it has a good relationship to the number of steps that are needed to finish the entire path of the unitary computation.

Computational universality 

Computationally universal quantum computers (in the sense of the following) correspond to any finite unitary quantum computer. A quantum universal computer is one whose gates and measurements can be carried out by any other unitary quantum computer, even if the details of the quantum computation are different.

A quantum universal computer is computationally universal if it can be constructed within any quantum computational model, including linear-time algorithms, circuit complexity, or the equivalence of two quantum computer models. This statement cannot be said for any quantum computation model based on the classical complexity model.

Quantum computational complexity, also called quantum algorithmic complexity, is the best upper bound for the computation time required to determine a computable problem on a given quantum computer. This is often called time complexity because it is a measure of the amount of time required to perform a computable quantum algorithm on a quantum computer. Thus quantum algorithm complexity is the best upper bound to the computational complexity in terms of the amount of time that is required for running a quantum algorithm.

For an input in the set of all 1's, the algorithm that determines the answer is called polynomial time algorithm, an exponential time algorithm is one that can be done in polynomial time on a quantum computer. The algorithm that determines the answer for all 1's is called NP-complete problem, an NP-complete is a mathematical theorem determining that any problem of NP-completeness can be solved in polynomial time or less.

For an input in the set of all 0's, the algorithm that determines the answer is called polynomial time algorithm, an exponential time algorithm is one that can b
e done in polynomial time on a quantum computer. The approach is to start the algorithm in the state that the measurement will be in a basis related to the quantum state of the quantum computing system. The algorithm that determines the answer for all of the 0's is called NP-complete problem, an NP-complete is a mathematical theorem determining that any problem of NP-completeness can be solved in polynomial time or less.

A quantum circuit with a unitary operation Q followed by a measurement M is called a (normal) quantum Turing machine if Q, Q^T, M are unitary matrices and M is a measurement of some specific basis of the Hilbert space.

For example the quantum CNOT gate with C as control is represented as [−2⊗2⊗0⊗−1] where −2 is on the left and both qubits on the right.

To measure an eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix A, as opposed to a complex-valued phase, requires unitary operators and measurement that are more general than the quantum gates used at the quantum mechanical level. It is more general because the operation that represents the measurement can be represented as a unitary operator, and can include operators for both qubit read operations and qubit control. The unitary operations are usually referred to as gates in the literature.

The unitary operators used at the quantum
r the probabilistic change). Probabilistic operation can be described by the CNOT gate matrix shown in the following equation which can transform a Qutrit-2 state to a Qutrit-1 state. The term in parenthesis on the left shows the basis for the QUTrit-1 qubit. The last column on the left shows two basis sets in which the QUTrit-1 qubit, e.g., A2 = +1I+1, B2 = −1I+1 and A5 = −1I+1, B5 = +1I+1 can be represented by C2 = R5 = I6+. The probabilistic qubit transformation can also be described by the CNOT gate if two basis sets are used, but a different notation is used. For example, in the quantum two qubit gate basis, the transformation is shown in the following two matrices C2′ and C2″:C2′ = R−1⊗L14, C2″ = L−1⊗C2′, with the matrix R′,L′ represents the QUTrit-2 and the matrix L′ indicates the QUTrit-1. It is important to note that the probabilistic operation defined by this set of matrices is not unique as it can create two different probabilistic transformations on the QUTrit states. A QUTrit state can be specified in one qubit state on qubit 3 or two qubit states on the qubit 2 and then the transformation can be described by the transformation A2 ⊗ B2 ⊗ C2″ where A2 = R6 and B2 = L12 in the quantum state representation. It is also important to note the probabilistic operations can be expressed in different bases by using the CNOT gate as shown for example in figure 3. In this case, the states B3 and B4 are mapped onto C2 = R13 and L12 respectively, and the probabilities of these states are given by R3 and L3. The probability of B6 which is on state R is now represented by L4 which is a different basis. Figure: Probabilistic qubit transformation C2 = R13 and L12 from R3 to L4

Quantumphysics and Qutrit quantum computer simulations The Qutrit quantum computer simulation, like other quantum computers is based on the notion of a quantum superposition state where two states are separated by an energy barrier. For example in a simple one qubit simulation all possible outcome
s are represented by the following matrix: 1⊗2 (1 ± a 1)⊗ (1⊗+a 2)0 (a 3)⊗0 (1 − b 1)⊗(1⊗−b 2)1 = 1 1 0 0, with 1, 2 denoting the qubit states and the 0 signifying the state of the superposition.

Quantumphysics and The Qutrit Hamiltonian It is important to note that a classical system with its discrete energy levels has no probabilistic transformation like in a Qutrit simulator; only states with some specified probabilities can be realized. For example, a classical three level quantum system with energy levels of K = 0, 1, 0 and K = 0 has no transformation of the CNOT gate basis. The Hamiltonian is a quantum mechanical operator that describes interactions among a system and environment at all of the energy levels, which are often described by classical stochastic processes. For each level within the spectrum, two types of interactions can occur. There is a static interaction, which defines the energy levels in the laboratory system and an environment of the same system. The interaction between this system and the environment can be described with a Hamiltonian that includes the energy levels of the system and a term that describes the interaction of the field or the environment with the environment of the system: H = H⊗L + v, where the field operator L is the Hamiltonian of the system and v is the coupling between the system and the environment, which is a non-zero real value. The term v has a classical mathematical nature in that there is no a priori definition to allow a nonzero value of v to be specified. The Hamiltonian L represents the interaction between a classical system of the same quantum state and an environment. The term v also contains a term that describes a coupling between the system and the environment through the interaction of the system and environment. One such example is the measurement of a measurement performed on the system with a quantum gate, in effect a time reversal device, in the presence of the environment represented by the bath at a
specific time. There are several possible ways to model such coupling and the term v. A simple approximation is to define the coupling as an infinitesimal amount of interaction. This is an appropriate first approximation only, as our goal is to model the coupling with classical physics, not to simulate in a computational device, but to mimic the coupling in a classical calculation like a stochastic process as a physical model of a system. The term v has the physical nature that no particular physical property of the system is directly coupled to v, but all of the couplings and interactions among the quantum states are included to represent the classical environment. In particular, we can consider the coupling term v as a real valued coupling constant that couples to the system in its state at all times; this coupling can be determined phenomenologically by a single real-valued parameter such as v. Another type of interaction term is the bath. The bath can represent any classical stochastic process with a Hamiltonian, where the bath operator is associated with a process, which occurs randomly in one of the times in a stochastic process.

Quantumphysics and The Qutrit Hamiltonian the Hamiltonian may include terms for coupling and a term that describes a coupling between the system and the bath at a particular time. Such coupling can represent direct coupling or it may represent coupling via a term that has the characteristic that it describes the interaction between two systems with many systems at a time. This kind of
circuits can be viewed as a hybrid between classical and quantum computing. The circuit we will be discussing will consist of the quantum gate and a classical circuit, in the standard manner seen in many other classic textbooks on quantum computation. We will first discuss the design of the quantum gate and the implementation of a quantum gate. We will then discuss the use of quantum circuits in the context of quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing. We will then discuss the importance of quantum error correction techniques, quantum computation via quantum teleportation, and quantum search, with application to a search engine for finding the correct answer for a simple question. One of us (D.R.) would like that readers know that the design and engineering practices of quantum devices are undergoing rapid changes. This is evidenced by these new developments in quantum architecture, quantum gates, and quantum devices. These ideas are being applied to specific applications and devices at the time! This is a significant issue in the field and can make it difficult to use modern tools to apply quantum principles to real problems. If a problem is too difficult to solve, the application of quantum technology may be useless. This is a major concern in computational neuroscience. To make the case that modern quantum technology has an important role to play in our society, we must understand how quantum phenomena function and how quantum computing works, before more can be done on them (Weyl & Larmor, 1984; Levitin, 2014). The application of quantum technologies is already affecting a variety of aspects of our lives. We consider our choices to help us make better choices today. We have the opportunity to help everyone in creating better choices tomorrow. We are all better off if our choices are less flawed. We would like to see this applied to the world of biological computing.

Cognitive BDD

Abstract

We have created a cognitive model of a human-androi
d (HA) interacting with an Android (AI). The model incorporates important cognitive aspects such as the ability to reason about other people’s intentions. In our model, cognitive aspects of cognition are encoded in the HA’s internal model of the situation. These models have been learned by the AI from experience with other agents and are not limited to a specific model that has been constructed in a theoretical manner. The AI then uses its experience to influence the HA’s decisions. This process is called BDD (behavioral decision making), or “behaviorism in a human brain.” The HA’s action plans are simulated by the AI so that the behaviors are designed to produce the cognitive outcomes the AI deems most likely. It is in BDD that an interaction between an intelligent agent and human-like behavior would occur.

Abstract

We introduce an Android-based system that can be programmed by a human with the intention to control a human-like robot. The system performs some computations and then produces instructions to control the robot. This programming can be done automatically by the human, without any user input.

Abstract

For the past few decades, the human brain has evolved to better understand the world. The ability to “understand” has improved our success for complex tasks because it allows us to understand what has been required when the system has acted on all the available information (i.e., the information is available in the form of a model). However, this understanding can be limited. The more a system acts on these available models, the more it may lose its understanding, and may act according to different rules to accomplish the same task. The ability to understand what has occurred is the best way to create system behavior that is robust to an agent’s actions because the system may evolve towards increasingly efficient behavior. On the basis of the system’s understanding, the system can optimize its actions by making its behaviors “obedient” and “rational,” t
he two terms being synonyms. Obedience and rationality are also used to describe the actions of other human-like agents.

Abstract

Computers have been developed to mimic humans for many purposes, from the playing of card games to the execution of complex mathematical operations. For example, computers are capable of calculating the square root of -3 instantly according to three different rules, in order to match the way humans do. This computer-mimicking ability is of great benefit when a system must interact with a human-like entity.

Abstract

The ability to generate novel activities and scenarios in a real-time manner has important consequences for human-robot interactions, and the development of tools that can accomplish this successfully often involves the development of models of human-like behavior. This paper reports the results of an evaluation of multiple models of human-robot interaction in various domains.

Abstract

People have a complex set of mental models about the physical world, and their predictions can vary strongly depending on which model they use. We studied this problem in the context of human-robot interactions. We used three different methods to produce a wide range of scenarios involving human-robot teams while trying to determine which method leads to the best results. The results of our experiments were consistent. We identified eight distinct methods for the development of a cognitive model: the ability to model the action, the ability to model human action behavior, the ability to model human intention, and the ability to model human action planning. We found that these methods converge on the same result. The first method, the ability to simulate human action behavior, was the most successful method across all three domains, producing the same amount of skill in all domains and using the same amount of time and effort. For domain #3 (robots that can manipulate objects), the third procedure, building a model of human action planning,
gave the strongest and most consistent results. We also found that the number of cognitive model types was related to the amount of time and effort required to successfully create a new scenario and that the skills necessary to complete a human-robot scenario are related to the agent’s cognitive profile. Overall, we have identified cognitive profiles that lead to successful human-robot interactions in different domains.

Abstract

Biological computing systems are growing at the speed of molecular evolution. Evolution has increased the complexity of molecular systems and has also made systems with multiple inputs and outputs. In a variety of experimental and simulation systems it has been shown that the input-output mapping for systems with multiple inputs and outputs may not need to be as complex as that for single-process systems with just one output. For multi-process systems, the existence of additional modes of operation and non-linearity in this mapping has been shown to impact performance and efficiency. We tested whether these new systems could also be engineered to operate and function better than systems with just the one output, and to achieve these we examined a number of computational modeling techniques to create more realistic biological behavior. Our results demonstrated that multi-output behavior can be engineered into biological designs very efficiently, in terms of both efficiency and the speed of the resulting system. Such design features should be considered when designing and engineering systems in which multiple input and output behaviors are observed, either experimentally or in modeling, and may ultimately make the creation of the systems from which an organism comes feasible and more economically efficient.

The concept of quantum mechanics originates in the atomic quantum world and is generally considered beyond the scope of this chapter.

This chapter consists of two parts: the first explores quantum logic gates and gates, and the second describes qubit quantum gates. Each will introduce the concepts and examples necessary for the remainder of this chapter.

Theoretical Concepts

A quantum logic gate is simply a mathematical transformation of a quantum system based on two or more qubits.

For example, a logical (logical-not) AND gate or a logical-xor gate are simple two-qubit quantum logic gates.

These gates contain two qubits only and the logic gates can perform the logical logical OR among two binary words or logical AND of two binary words. Logical OR and logical OR can be defined as follows:

xOR, where x is a binary word

xXOR, where x is a binary word

xIN, where x is a binary word

These gates are implemented using the following quantum information (eavesdropping) operations. The NOT operation performs the logical NOT of binary strings of 2 bits. Note that the NOT has a conjugate operation called XOR, that is, it is a complement of the logical OR (and also has a negation operation called XNOR).

A Boolean NOT and a Boolean XNOR represent respectively the logical NOR and logical XNOR for a binary string of 3 binary bits. Note that XNOR can be implemented using two xOR gates, while NOT is equivalent to performing it multiple times by using a controlled NOT and an inverter.

We will not discuss a qubit-logic gates that contain qubits because their complexity (especially the number of quantum logic gates) are much more than that of two qubit-logic gates.

Logic Gates in a Two-Qubit Model

First, we will define a two-qubit logical OR gate
as a circuit which takes two input qubits and produces one output qubit, both of which are the same two qubit bit string. Logical OR can be defined as a product of 2 two-qubit gates and another two-qubit gate. We will now describe the NOT operation along with its conjugate. Note that the NOT gate can be implemented using two xOR gates.

Given this gate, we will consider the first input qubit and the second input qubit along with the first output qubit as well as the third output qubit.

Figure 3.a defines the NOT gate as a NOT gate that can simply be implemented by a controlled NOT gate and an inverter.

By implementing NOT with a control NOT and inverter, we have that:

yNOR = { |xXOR|, |x NOT| },

yNOT = { |yOR|, |yNOT| }

yOR = { |z|, |z AND| }

yNOT = { |zNOT|, |z AND NOT| }

yXOR = { |xOR_z|, |xOR_z AND| }

For the NOT gate to be implementable, we must find the appropriate product of 2 two-qubit logical gates. A logical AND can be implemented with the addition of 2 xOR gates and addition of 2 XNOR gates to transform the logical NOT to a logical AND. A logical OR with the same two-qubit gates that implements NOT can be implemented using the product of 2 xOR gates and another 2 NOT gates.

Fig 3.a shows yNOR and yNOT gates. Fig 3.b, however, shows the product of two logical XOR gates.

Fig 3.a: NOT gate

Fig 3.b: AND gate

Now consider the following three qubit gates as shown in Fig. 4. From this, we can see that both of these gate can be implemented by simply using a XOR gate and a NOT gate as the first and second qubit gates with a second qubit which we call the control.

Fig 4: XOR-NOT gate

Figure 5.a shows the logical XOR gate. From this, we can see that the gate can be implemented by the following two-qubit gate.

Fig 5.a: QXOR

Fig 5.b: QXNOR

The product of two logical gates can be described by a controlled NOT and also an inverter (a single-qubit Pauli matrix).

Fig. 4 shows the QXOR gate. This is equivalent to the AND gate used above. In addition, its i
nverse, the QXNOR gate can be written as a logical AND gate. This is because their inverse is the exclusive OR operation, or XOR gate.

We can represent a logical NOR (not) gate similarly to a NOT gate. A logical NOT gate can be written as a control xOR gate followed by 2 xOR gates (one of which is not), and an inverter. We have:

yNOR = { |xNOR|, |xNOR AND |xNOR|, |xNOT| }

Note that the xNOR gate and the xNOR gate are NOT gates, which is equivalent to being a control NOT. In addition, the X and XNOR gates can be implemented using the following three-qubit gates.

Fig 5.a shows the QXNOR gate. Note that both left and right side of the gate are a NOT gate.

Fig 5.b shows the gate to be implemented with two XNOR gates, one of which is not. This is equivalent to performing a NOT gate multiple times.

For the QXNOR gate to be implemented (i.e., the left-hand side of the gate is not inverted), we have the following set of equations. Note that xNOR and xNOR are NOT gates.

For these equations, the OR operation is equivalent to XOR as both operators are logical OR. Note that xNOR can be implemented using two xNOT gates and two XNOR gates each of which can be implemented using one xOR gate and an inverter.

For the QXNOR gate to be implemented (i.e., the right-hand side of the gate is not inverted), we have the following set of equations. Note that xNOR can be implemented as a NOT gate using twoNOT gates and an inverter.

In conclusion, a logical NOR gate can be implemented using four XOR gates (the last two of which are not).

Quantum Logic Gates in a Multi-Qubit Model

Next, we will define a two-qubit quantum OR and XOR gates similar to the NOT gate and its conjugate.

Q: A state in two-dimensional Hilbert space,

a state represented by vector state σ, and

a measurement result.

For unitary operations, [0⊗0⊗0⊗−1] states are the states where the second element, [0,0,1,0] is unity and the first two components, [0,1,−1, 0] is zero. The measurements result are zero, one, and two, represented by the vector [1,0,0,0], …, [0,0,0,1], …, [0,0,1,0], ….

Fig. 2. A Quantum operation

Fig. 2 shows how the CNOT gate is defined. The first multiplication line applies the operation to a qubit (2). The second multiplication line applies the operation to an ancillary qubit called the control qubit (3). The first multiplication line is called the CNOT gate. The second multiplication line is the control qubit operation.

Fig. 3. Quantum operation definition

Each of these four lines is called a qubit line. The CNOT gate can be represented by a set of qubits of which each qubit performs a particular operation. The set of qubits can be represented by four vectors of values [−0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], [0,0.5,-0.5,0.5], [0,0,0.5,-0.5], if the system is operated on by the CNOT in sequence that results in the state of one qubit and in the value −1 for the control qubit and in the value 0 for the qubit one. The CNOT operation is one of the two distinct operations that can be performed on a quantum computer. It consists in a series of operations using different types of quantum devices such as a quantum gate or a set of qubits in the circuit. The set of these gates and quantum gates is called the CNOT gate set.

Figure 1. CNOT

Fig. 4. Controlled-NOT operation

The CNOT gate also can be represented by two qubits of which both qubits have the same basis, that is, an orthogonal basis. In the description of the operation, the qubits have different basis. Th
us the CNOT gate can be represented by the two terms [−0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], [0,0.5,-0.5,0.5], [1,0,0,0]. The operator used to apply this two-qubit operation is called the Controlled-NOT (‖C-NOT‖). The second term is a two-qubit operation and the basis is used to describe qubits of a set or in the formula of the gate set. As the CNOT can be represented by [−−−−−−−−] as in FIG. 4, the CNOT gate can be represented by two qubits of which both qubits have the same basis, that is, an orthogonal basis. In its description the qubits have different basis. Thus the controlled-not is a two qubit operation and the basis is called a Controlled-Not basis, it is also called Controlled Not for short. The operator used to apply this two-qubit operation is called Controlled-Not(‖C-NOT‖). The controlled-not operation allows one to apply a CNOT to a control qubit with the property that in such a case the control qubit is in one state instead of in two states. The two terms are the expressions used to represent three-qubit operations that can be represented by a controlled-NOT gate operation (see Fig. 5).

Fig. 5. Controlled-NOT operation

From the first term [−0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5] on one qubit is read as −0.5 and the second term [0,0.5,-0.5,0.5], one qubit is read as = 0.5, the expression for the second qubit is then −0.5 and the third bit is read as 0. So the controlled-not operation turns a state such as [−0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5] into a state such as [0,0.5,0.5,0.5]. The control qubit state is a mixed state (all the qubits of the state become pure) such that the third qubit, the mixed state is −1.

Let σ* be a state that represents the controlled-not operation. As all the bits of the quantum computation are represented by one qubit, we can apply a controlled-not operation to a single qubit σ. It is possible to transform any state into the controlled-not state σ*. For example, if the states of a superposition of two pure states ρ1 and ρ2, denoted by ρ (ρ1,ρ2), can be represented by either ρ1 or ρ2
or both ρ1 and ρ2, the result for any one qubit can be either ρ1 or ρ2. However, if we want a product of two states, say ρ1 (ρ2) and thus we want to apply ρ1 to a qubit where a measurement would result in the state =0, we can apply the controlled-not with the state σ. If the state σ satisfies the condition σ⊗ σ* = σ, then σ is a classical variable, representing as a state by θ^(σ)* that can by applied to a classical state as a quantum operation. If σ* is a mixed state, then σ* = σ^+ = σ^+, where |σ^+| = σ^+ |σ^+|. If we apply a controlled-NOT gate for a set of quantum states, then σ^+ and σ^+ are mixed states with σ^+ = σ*^+, where |σ^+| = |σ^+|.

To define the controlled-NOT gate set, we need to assign a basis to the qubits that can be represented by the expressions [−−−−−−−|0⊗0⊗−1⊗0⊗−1⊗1⊗0⊗−1⊗0⊗−1⊗
perations are required for that which is described through the probability of accepting or rejecting that quantum result (e.g., the operation A or A1 = R6 or A1 = L6 is required to accept probabilistically the outputs of qubit 2 and qubit 1 for the CNOT circuit. This is known as the probabilistic operation). These operations are the logical gate operations that are used for both CNOT gate and OR gate. In the following table: Quantum CNOT gate logical gate operation CNOT gate logic matrix The Qubit state A logical Gate operation A1 = R6| A3 | B2 | B3 A2 = L6| R6| A3| B2∩C2| R2 | I−1+1|1|−1|−1| A3|B2∩C2| L6| 0 C2 | I + 1 | 0 C2 | −1|−1|−1 | L−1|1|−1| 0| I+1|1| −1) C2(= L−1) | 0|1| 1|−1| − 1|1|1| 1| −1|−1| −1| 1 0|−1 B2 ∩ C2 → B3 →− A3| −A3|− B2| − B3| − A3|− B3| − 2 A2 ∩ C2 → A2 | I+1+ 1 |−1|−1|−1 |−1 | 1 I+1|−1| −1|1| −1+1| − −−−−−− 2 A3|−B2| − 2 B3|− B3| − 1 0|I−1+1|1| −1|−1| −1∩C2 | −A3|− B2|−B3| −1 I+1|−1|0|−−−−−− − 1 B3|−B2| −− B3|−−−−−−−−−−−−− B2 ∩ C2 → B2 | − − −−−−− + B2∩C2 →B3 → −A3
So far we have defined the CNOT gate basis R6 and L12 as the two bases used to build up the product matrix A1 ⊗ A2 = S2 and A3 ⊗ A5 = S2. In order to simplify these terms the following can be derived by the following process. First is the operation C2 on qubit 2, A2 ◑ B2, A3 ⊑ B3. As it has to take into account the probabilistic operation of a qubit it is necessary to write the product matrix A1 ⊗ A2 = A1 B2 ◑ A2 + A1−1 B2 + A3 B3 = S2, as shown in table 1. Second is the operation of A3 ◑ B3, A2 ⊗ B3 + A3 ⊗ B2 = S3 as it is not considered as a product matrix. The operation A3 ⊗ B3 can change the state of qubit 3 by the probabilistic operation A3 ⊗ B3 = C2. Third is the operation A3 ⊗ B2, A3 ⊗ B3. This operation accepts a probabilistic outcome when the state of qubit 3 is affected through the CNOT gate A3 ⊗ B2 = R4, then the state is C2 and the probabilistic outcome is accepted (A3 ⊗ B2 on qubit 3 and so B3 in qubit 2). However when qubit 3 is involved there is an operation that ac
cepts a probabilistic outcome by the operation A3 ⊗ B2 on qubit 3 and the probabilistic outcome is accepted. By setting the qubits Q1 and Q2 the probabilistic effects are cancelled and the CNOT gate has taken into account so the probabilistic operation in C− does not take into account the actual state of Q1 and Q2 during the operation A3 ⊗ B2. The operation A3 ⊗ B1 and A3 ⊗ B2 which are shown in figure 2 are the probabilistic operation A3 ⊗ B3 and C3, respectively, and A3 ⊗ B1 is not considered as a probabilistic operation and A3 ⊗ B2 is not considered as a probabilistic operation as all they have were in the previous process. Finally, for the operation of A1 ◑ A3 = H1H3H1H3, the operation will be considered from only one qubit and is considered in the A1 ⊗ A3 = S2 = H1H3H1H3 = A3 ⊗ A5 = S2.

Quit the quantum computer using a single qubit, let the computer start the operation, and then you can check the correctness of the program by running it on another quantum computer.

The CNOT gate C− has two different modes of operation, depending on how a qubit of the quantum computer is involved. If a probabilistic operation were to take place on a single qubit, the operation becomes: (1) the probabilistic operation in C− and so C − as shown in the second part of the CNOT gate matrix A5 = S2 and then is taken into account and is ignored in the final value of the CNOT matrix A5 = S2, or (2) the probabilistic operation A 5 ⊗ A 2 = = 1 where A 5 = S2. To implement either mode of operation an operation on only one qubit is required.
irst, we have the quantum state,
state the logical bit is either in one of the states 0 or 1). We will also write down a quantum circuit that can implement the Hadamard gate for two qubits using the logical gates.

the idea of quantum computer as a quantum memory that can perform calculations for data processing. Quantum computers have been around for about forty years, and the ability to store a quantum state and to store quantum information has been demonstrated. However, to perform calculations on the size of supercomputers, quantum computers require very high precision logic gates. This precision is what makes the calculations so complex. Quantum logic is the combination of quantum gates to create quantum information that can be used to calculate a function on the two-qubit quantum-mechanical system. Quantum computers can only carry out one calculations at a time because quantum information cannot be stored in a quantum memory in a logical state. The complexity of any calculation using quantum information creates the challenge for the quantum computation.

The goal of our work in quantum computing is to demonstrate the quantum memory effects in this area. Quantum computing is not only to provide information, but also to have the ability to process it later after storing it. Quantum memory effect in quantum computation allows quantum information to be stored in a quantum state for subsequent processing. In an experiment of the type that we have in mind, one should have a qubit which can store quantum information and another qubit that has an operation to perform for quantum information. This second qubit will be read from, the other qubit stored in it. The operation performed by this second qubit determines the result of the computation, thus the whole two qubit quantum process is used to represent one function. In this experiment we will use the logical operators, and the measurement and measurement probabilities to implement a logical function.

the quantum circuits that implement the logical
functions can be written down in the form of a quantum circuit. The quantum circuit contains 2-bit, one-qubit, and two-qubit logical gates. For a single logical qubit we have the AND and NOT gates and a gate which can either flip up or down the state of a single qubit. For a two-qubit quantum gate we have the XOR gate, and we can make a single qubit operation by flipping up states of either one qubit or down states of the other qubit which flip the state accordingly. Note that the AND and NOT gates act to produce the logical bit value of one if the state of either logical qubit is zero and zero otherwise. In this work we implement a 2-qubit quantum gate that performs the logical operation. The physical implementation is a two qubit quantum circuit.

the measurement process is the process where a quantum state is measured, and a measurement result is measured or recorded by a measurement apparatus. In quantum computation, qubits can be measured to perform quantum operations. There are many ways, but we will use the following basic measurement techniques which we will explore in the work.

There are two main measurement techniques that exist to perform a measurement on a quantum system. One is the projection measurement. This is the simplest measurement, which measures the state of the quantum system by simply sending a probe particle (or a photon) through the interaction region. The other is the projective measurement. This has two parts: a control measurement and the measurement. A projective measurement is the measurement of the state of a quantum system. A control measurement must first be performed and then a second measurement is performed on the system, and then the control measurement and measurement are combined. A general scheme of the projective measurement is shown in the figure (Figure 1).

The projection qubit measurements are represented by a projective measurement in a two-qubit system (Figure 1), where the two qubits are in the logical zero state. As
shown in Figure 1, the measurement for the two logical qubits is a control measurement. For each qubit, only the qubit with the logical "0" is measured. The logical operation is then performed on the qubit with the logical "0". The state of the logical "0" after the logical operation is then revealed. As shown in Figure 1, A and B respectively denote a control measurement and measurement in the two logical qubits.

The projective measurement is one of the approaches used to implement the quantum gate. The idea is to perform a control measurement and project on a certain value/direction of the electron (quantum state) so that subsequent operations can be performed. The control measurement can be done with a control measurement on each logical qubit, or alternatively, on all three logical qubits. Using the measurement and a quantum gate one can perform a unitary (controlled) operation on a quantum system. The measurement, as shown in Fig 2, is performed on one logical qubit. If the state of the quantum system is 0, we record that there is no control information associated with the measurement. This can be used to make a measurement for a control qubit. We then send a photon through the interaction region. If its path is parallel to the qubit in the logical "0" state, we send a photon through the measurement aperture. If the path of the photon is orthogonal to the logical operation, we record the information of the measurement state at the output of the measurement apparatus. In each case of a measurement we obtain the recorded measurement result. For example, the measurement results given the measurement of the logical "0" are 0 for A and 1 for B.

Figure 2 The measurement for the 2-qubit quantum unitary operation can be made using a projective measurement.

the measurement device that can detect the result of the measurement of the two qubits and measure the resulting logical state for the two qubits. The measurement device includes four measurement devices (two for
each of the two logical qubits), which each have three inputs of the photon to be sent from the measurement apparatus through the interaction region. If the state of the quantum system is 0 or 1, the incoming photon is in parallel transport to the measurement device where a control measurement is performed on the logical qubit, with the control measurement result being recorded. If the state of the quantum system is in an unknown state, the measurement device records the state of the quantum system. The measurement device has two outputs: the measurement result, and the control information.

Let us consider the logical operation that is a logical AND of the states of the two logical qubits. This will be the basis for performing the logical unitary operation on qubits. We will use a logical AND operation to implement a two-qubit logical operation.

The logical AND operation of two qubits is accomplished by the measurement of the first qubit and the measurement of the second qubit, as shown in Figure 3. In every measurement result we will get the logical "1" or the logical "0". (Because of the logical operations, we can use the measurement results as the target of the next logical AND operation.)

Figure 3 The logical AND operation is made with a control measurement and two measurements (a control measurement of the first qubit and a measurement of the second qubit).

A logical AND operation is a quantum operation, and a state with
qubits in the gate set that apply one operation to a qubit, and  qubits in the gate set that apply another operation to a qubit.

In quantum computers the state of the register that contains the quantum states of all the qubits will not have another basis. Because of this, the computation of a physical algorithm can only consist in transforming or sorting a superposition of these states, called the quantum superposition.

Computing
The problem of computing cannot be solved in principle using a classical computer, a device that can produce definitive outcomes directly. This is because quantum theory states that information should be measured as a function of time, which must be treated as a continuous variable in order to compute computations.

Quantum computing

Physical computer 
Quantum computers (also known as quantum information, quantum computation, or quantum computation) have the same physical structure as classical computers, but they use quantum particles to control the computer’s behavior and work directly without the use of central computing devices such as a central processing unit, a computer’s hard drive, or a keyboard, as in the classical machine. These quantum particles include individual qubits and quantum bits, which are just logical information (bits), and the individual units of the quantum computer are called quantum processors. There are various physical approaches of building a quantum computer.

One approach is to use physical gates, called quantum gates, to manipulate the state of quantum systems. A quantum gate is a set of operations that allows a specific quantum system, such as the quantum annealer, a quantum computer, or a quantum gate set, that can perform one or more quantum operations at a time. The specific set of quantum gates or gate sets that are used to build a quantum computer are defined by the mathematical properties of the set in question. For example, in a quantum-logic processor based on the concept of quantum gates, a sup
erposition of the states {0,1} of qubits has a value of one only if and only if that quantum gate is applied. Such quantum operations are called quantum gates and the quantum gates they define are the quantum gates.

To use quantum computers, a classical bit called a 'digital input' is encoded in a 1 or 0 ( binary representation). The classical bit can thus be viewed as being in a superposition of a value ‘1’, represented by '0', and a value ‘0’, represented by ‘1’. The computational problem of computing the ‘0’ and the ‘1’ are equivalent. Computations in quantum computers can be represented and manipulated with different quantum operations depending if the quantum operations are performed individually or performed in a quantum gate set. Such quantum operations are called quantum gates and the quantum gates they define are the quantum gates. The quantum circuits are also defined by the mathematical properties of the quantum gates they define in quantum quantum computsions such as for example the quantum CNOT gate.

Optimisation
One major aim of quantum computers is to develop methods for designing quantum circuits that are so simple that they are computationally unfeasible for a classical computer. The computational complexity of a problem is the length of a shortest unitary quantum gate algorithm.

Many quantum circuits are optimised for some number of operations (e.g., 4 or 5), where a larger circuit is the larger the set of quantum gates that can be implemented on it. Optimal quantum circuit depth is the maximum size of the unit quantum gates that can be implemented. In practice, the circuit depth is not optimized due to limitations on the number of quantum gates that can be implemented on a given computer. An alternative measure of the circuit depth is called circuit depth complexity and the circuit depth is the least number of quantum gates used to complete a circuit. A circuit depth computation can then be used as an efficient measure of the computational comp
lexity. The advantage with using the circuit depth as the measure of complexity is that it has a good relationship to the number of steps that are needed to finish the entire path of the unitary computation.

Computational universality 

Computationally universal quantum computers (in the sense of the following) correspond to any finite unitary quantum computer. A quantum universal computer is one whose gates and measurements can be carried out by any other unitary quantum computer, even if the details of the quantum computation are different.

A quantum universal computer is computationally universal if it can be constructed within any quantum computational model, including linear-time algorithms, circuit complexity, or the equivalence of two quantum computer models. This statement cannot be said for any quantum computation model based on the classical complexity model.

Quantum computational complexity, also called quantum algorithmic complexity, is the best upper bound for the computation time required to determine a computable problem on a given quantum computer. This is often called time complexity because it is a measure of the amount of time required to perform a computable quantum algorithm on a quantum computer. Thus quantum algorithm complexity is the best upper bound to the computational complexity in terms of the amount of time that is required for running a quantum algorithm.

For an input in the set of all 1's, the algorithm that determines the answer is called polynomial time algorithm, an exponential time algorithm is one that can be done in polynomial time on a quantum computer. The algorithm that determines the answer for all 1's is called NP-complete problem, an NP-complete is a mathematical theorem determining that any problem of NP-completeness can be solved in polynomial time or less.

For an input in the set of all 0's, the algorithm that determines the answer is called polynomial time algorithm, an exponential time algorithm is one that can b
e done in polynomial time on a quantum computer. The approach is to start the algorithm in the state that the measurement will be in a basis related to the quantum state of the quantum computing system. The algorithm that determines the answer for all of the 0's is called NP-complete problem, an NP-complete is a mathematical theorem determining that any problem of NP-completeness can be solved in polynomial time or less.

A quantum circuit with a unitary operation Q followed by a measurement M is called a (normal) quantum Turing machine if Q, Q^T, M are unitary matrices and M is a measurement of some specific basis of the Hilbert space.

For example the quantum CNOT gate with C as control is represented as [−2⊗2⊗0⊗−1] where −2 is on the left and both qubits on the right.

To measure an eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix A, as opposed to a complex-valued phase, requires unitary operators and measurement that are more general than the quantum gates used at the quantum mechanical level. It is more general because the operation that represents the measurement can be represented as a unitary operator, and can include operators for both qubit read operations and qubit control. The unitary operations are usually referred to as gates in the literature.

The unitary operators used at the quantum
r the probabilistic change). Probabilistic operation can be described by the CNOT gate matrix shown in the following equation which can transform a Qutrit-2 state to a Qutrit-1 state. The term in parenthesis on the left shows the basis for the QUTrit-1 qubit. The last column on the left shows two basis sets in which the QUTrit-1 qubit, e.g., A2 = +1I+1, B2 = −1I+1 and A5 = −1I+1, B5 = +1I+1 can be represented by C2 = R5 = I6+. The probabilistic qubit transformation can also be described by the CNOT gate if two basis sets are used, but a different notation is used. For example, in the quantum two qubit gate basis, the transformation is shown in the following two matrices C2′ and C2″:C2′ = R−1⊗L14, C2″ = L−1⊗C2′, with the matrix R′,L′ represents the QUTrit-2 and the matrix L′ indicates the QUTrit-1. It is important to note that the probabilistic operation defined by this set of matrices is not unique as it can create two different probabilistic transformations on the QUTrit states. A QUTrit state can be specified in one qubit state on qubit 3 or two qubit states on the qubit 2 and then the transformation can be described by the transformation A2 ⊗ B2 ⊗ C2″ where A2 = R6 and B2 = L12 in the quantum state representation. It is also important to note the probabilistic operations can be expressed in different bases by using the CNOT gate as shown for example in figure 3. In this case, the states B3 and B4 are mapped onto C2 = R13 and L12 respectively, and the probabilities of these states are given by R3 and L3. The probability of B6 which is on state R is now represented by L4 which is a different basis. Figure: Probabilistic qubit transformation C2 = R13 and L12 from R3 to L4

Quantumphysics and Qutrit quantum computer simulations The Qutrit quantum computer simulation, like other quantum computers is based on the notion of a quantum superposition state where two states are separated by an energy barrier. For example in a simple one qubit simulation all possible outcome
s are represented by the following matrix: 1⊗2 (1 ± a 1)⊗ (1⊗+a 2)0 (a 3)⊗0 (1 − b 1)⊗(1⊗−b 2)1 = 1 1 0 0, with 1, 2 denoting the qubit states and the 0 signifying the state of the superposition.

Quantumphysics and The Qutrit Hamiltonian It is important to note that a classical system with its discrete energy levels has no probabilistic transformation like in a Qutrit simulator; only states with some specified probabilities can be realized. For example, a classical three level quantum system with energy levels of K = 0, 1, 0 and K = 0 has no transformation of the CNOT gate basis. The Hamiltonian is a quantum mechanical operator that describes interactions among a system and environment at all of the energy levels, which are often described by classical stochastic processes. For each level within the spectrum, two types of interactions can occur. There is a static interaction, which defines the energy levels in the laboratory system and an environment of the same system. The interaction between this system and the environment can be described with a Hamiltonian that includes the energy levels of the system and a term that describes the interaction of the field or the environment with the environment of the system: H = H⊗L + v, where the field operator L is the Hamiltonian of the system and v is the coupling between the system and the environment, which is a non-zero real value. The term v has a classical mathematical nature in that there is no a priori definition to allow a nonzero value of v to be specified. The Hamiltonian L represents the interaction between a classical system of the same quantum state and an environment. The term v also contains a term that describes a coupling between the system and the environment through the interaction of the system and environment. One such example is the measurement of a measurement performed on the system with a quantum gate, in effect a time reversal device, in the presence of the environment represented by the bath at a
specific time. There are several possible ways to model such coupling and the term v. A simple approximation is to define the coupling as an infinitesimal amount of interaction. This is an appropriate first approximation only, as our goal is to model the coupling with classical physics, not to simulate in a computational device, but to mimic the coupling in a classical calculation like a stochastic process as a physical model of a system. The term v has the physical nature that no particular physical property of the system is directly coupled to v, but all of the couplings and interactions among the quantum states are included to represent the classical environment. In particular, we can consider the coupling term v as a real valued coupling constant that couples to the system in its state at all times; this coupling can be determined phenomenologically by a single real-valued parameter such as v. Another type of interaction term is the bath. The bath can represent any classical stochastic process with a Hamiltonian, where the bath operator is associated with a process, which occurs randomly in one of the times in a stochastic process.

Quantumphysics and The Qutrit Hamiltonian the Hamiltonian may include terms for coupling and a term that describes a coupling between the system and the bath at a particular time. Such coupling can represent direct coupling or it may represent coupling via a term that has the characteristic that it describes the interaction between two systems with many systems at a time. This kind of
circuits can be viewed as a hybrid between classical and quantum computing. The circuit we will be discussing will consist of the quantum gate and a classical circuit, in the standard manner seen in many other classic textbooks on quantum computation. We will first discuss the design of the quantum gate and the implementation of a quantum gate. We will then discuss the use of quantum circuits in the context of quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing. We will then discuss the importance of quantum error correction techniques, quantum computation via quantum teleportation, and quantum search, with application to a search engine for finding the correct answer for a simple question. One of us (D.R.) would like that readers know that the design and engineering practices of quantum devices are undergoing rapid changes. This is evidenced by these new developments in quantum architecture, quantum gates, and quantum devices. These ideas are being applied to specific applications and devices at the time! This is a significant issue in the field and can make it difficult to use modern tools to apply quantum principles to real problems. If a problem is too difficult to solve, the application of quantum technology may be useless. This is a major concern in computational neuroscience. To make the case that modern quantum technology has an important role to play in our society, we must understand how quantum phenomena function and how quantum computing works, before more can be done on them (Weyl & Larmor, 1984; Levitin, 2014). The application of quantum technologies is already affecting a variety of aspects of our lives. We consider our choices to help us make better choices today. We have the opportunity to help everyone in creating better choices tomorrow. We are all better off if our choices are less flawed. We would like to see this applied to the world of biological computing.

Cognitive BDD

Abstract

We have created a cognitive model of a human-androi
d (HA) interacting with an Android (AI). The model incorporates important cognitive aspects such as the ability to reason about other people’s intentions. In our model, cognitive aspects of cognition are encoded in the HA’s internal model of the situation. These models have been learned by the AI from experience with other agents and are not limited to a specific model that has been constructed in a theoretical manner. The AI then uses its experience to influence the HA’s decisions. This process is called BDD (behavioral decision making), or “behaviorism in a human brain.” The HA’s action plans are simulated by the AI so that the behaviors are designed to produce the cognitive outcomes the AI deems most likely. It is in BDD that an interaction between an intelligent agent and human-like behavior would occur.

Abstract

We introduce an Android-based system that can be programmed by a human with the intention to control a human-like robot. The system performs some computations and then produces instructions to control the robot. This programming can be done automatically by the human, without any user input.

Abstract

For the past few decades, the human brain has evolved to better understand the world. The ability to “understand” has improved our success for complex tasks because it allows us to understand what has been required when the system has acted on all the available information (i.e., the information is available in the form of a model). However, this understanding can be limited. The more a system acts on these available models, the more it may lose its understanding, and may act according to different rules to accomplish the same task. The ability to understand what has occurred is the best way to create system behavior that is robust to an agent’s actions because the system may evolve towards increasingly efficient behavior. On the basis of the system’s understanding, the system can optimize its actions by making its behaviors “obedient” and “rational,” t
he two terms being synonyms. Obedience and rationality are also used to describe the actions of other human-like agents.

Abstract

Computers have been developed to mimic humans for many purposes, from the playing of card games to the execution of complex mathematical operations. For example, computers are capable of calculating the square root of -3 instantly according to three different rules, in order to match the way humans do. This computer-mimicking ability is of great benefit when a system must interact with a human-like entity.

Abstract

The ability to generate novel activities and scenarios in a real-time manner has important consequences for human-robot interactions, and the development of tools that can accomplish this successfully often involves the development of models of human-like behavior. This paper reports the results of an evaluation of multiple models of human-robot interaction in various domains.

Abstract

People have a complex set of mental models about the physical world, and their predictions can vary strongly depending on which model they use. We studied this problem in the context of human-robot interactions. We used three different methods to produce a wide range of scenarios involving human-robot teams while trying to determine which method leads to the best results. The results of our experiments were consistent. We identified eight distinct methods for the development of a cognitive model: the ability to model the action, the ability to model human action behavior, the ability to model human intention, and the ability to model human action planning. We found that these methods converge on the same result. The first method, the ability to simulate human action behavior, was the most successful method across all three domains, producing the same amount of skill in all domains and using the same amount of time and effort. For domain #3 (robots that can manipulate objects), the third procedure, building a model of human action planning,
gave the strongest and most consistent results. We also found that the number of cognitive model types was related to the amount of time and effort required to successfully create a new scenario and that the skills necessary to complete a human-robot scenario are related to the agent’s cognitive profile. Overall, we have identified cognitive profiles that lead to successful human-robot interactions in different domains.

Abstract

Biological computing systems are growing at the speed of molecular evolution. Evolution has increased the complexity of molecular systems and has also made systems with multiple inputs and outputs. In a variety of experimental and simulation systems it has been shown that the input-output mapping for systems with multiple inputs and outputs may not need to be as complex as that for single-process systems with just one output. For multi-process systems, the existence of additional modes of operation and non-linearity in this mapping has been shown to impact performance and efficiency. We tested whether these new systems could also be engineered to operate and function better than systems with just the one output, and to achieve these we examined a number of computational modeling techniques to create more realistic biological behavior. Our results demonstrated that multi-output behavior can be engineered into biological designs very efficiently, in terms of both efficiency and the speed of the resulting system. Such design features should be considered when designing and engineering systems in which multiple input and output behaviors are observed, either experimentally or in modeling, and may ultimately make the creation of the systems from which an organism comes feasible and more economically efficient.

The concept of quantum mechanics originates in the atomic quantum world and is generally considered beyond the scope of this chapter.

This chapter consists of two parts: the first explores quantum logic gates and gates, and the second describes qubit quantum gates. Each will introduce the concepts and examples necessary for the remainder of this chapter.

Theoretical Concepts

A quantum logic gate is simply a mathematical transformation of a quantum system based on two or more qubits.

For example, a logical (logical-not) AND gate or a logical-xor gate are simple two-qubit quantum logic gates.

These gates contain two qubits only and the logic gates can perform the logical logical OR among two binary words or logical AND of two binary words. Logical OR and logical OR can be defined as follows:

xOR, where x is a binary word

xXOR, where x is a binary word

xIN, where x is a binary word

These gates are implemented using the following quantum information (eavesdropping) operations. The NOT operation performs the logical NOT of binary strings of 2 bits. Note that the NOT has a conjugate operation called XOR, that is, it is a complement of the logical OR (and also has a negation operation called XNOR).

A Boolean NOT and a Boolean XNOR represent respectively the logical NOR and logical XNOR for a binary string of 3 binary bits. Note that XNOR can be implemented using two xOR gates, while NOT is equivalent to performing it multiple times by using a controlled NOT and an inverter.

We will not discuss a qubit-logic gates that contain qubits because their complexity (especially the number of quantum logic gates) are much more than that of two qubit-logic gates.

Logic Gates in a Two-Qubit Model

First, we will define a two-qubit logical OR gate
as a circuit which takes two input qubits and produces one output qubit, both of which are the same two qubit bit string. Logical OR can be defined as a product of 2 two-qubit gates and another two-qubit gate. We will now describe the NOT operation along with its conjugate. Note that the NOT gate can be implemented using two xOR gates.

Given this gate, we will consider the first input qubit and the second input qubit along with the first output qubit as well as the third output qubit.

Figure 3.a defines the NOT gate as a NOT gate that can simply be implemented by a controlled NOT gate and an inverter.

By implementing NOT with a control NOT and inverter, we have that:

yNOR = { |xXOR|, |x NOT| },

yNOT = { |yOR|, |yNOT| }

yOR = { |z|, |z AND| }

yNOT = { |zNOT|, |z AND NOT| }

yXOR = { |xOR_z|, |xOR_z AND| }

For the NOT gate to be implementable, we must find the appropriate product of 2 two-qubit logical gates. A logical AND can be implemented with the addition of 2 xOR gates and addition of 2 XNOR gates to transform the logical NOT to a logical AND. A logical OR with the same two-qubit gates that implements NOT can be implemented using the product of 2 xOR gates and another 2 NOT gates.

Fig 3.a shows yNOR and yNOT gates. Fig 3.b, however, shows the product of two logical XOR gates.

Fig 3.a: NOT gate

Fig 3.b: AND gate

Now consider the following three qubit gates as shown in Fig. 4. From this, we can see that both of these gate can be implemented by simply using a XOR gate and a NOT gate as the first and second qubit gates with a second qubit which we call the control.

Fig 4: XOR-NOT gate

Figure 5.a shows the logical XOR gate. From this, we can see that the gate can be implemented by the following two-qubit gate.

Fig 5.a: QXOR

Fig 5.b: QXNOR

The product of two logical gates can be described by a controlled NOT and also an inverter (a single-qubit Pauli matrix).

Fig. 4 shows the QXOR gate. This is equivalent to the AND gate used above. In addition, its i
nverse, the QXNOR gate can be written as a logical AND gate. This is because their inverse is the exclusive OR operation, or XOR gate.

We can represent a logical NOR (not) gate similarly to a NOT gate. A logical NOT gate can be written as a control xOR gate followed by 2 xOR gates (one of which is not), and an inverter. We have:

yNOR = { |xNOR|, |xNOR AND |xNOR|, |xNOT| }

Note that the xNOR gate and the xNOR gate are NOT gates, which is equivalent to being a control NOT. In addition, the X and XNOR gates can be implemented using the following three-qubit gates.

Fig 5.a shows the QXNOR gate. Note that both left and right side of the gate are a NOT gate.

Fig 5.b shows the gate to be implemented with two XNOR gates, one of which is not. This is equivalent to performing a NOT gate multiple times.

For the QXNOR gate to be implemented (i.e., the left-hand side of the gate is not inverted), we have the following set of equations. Note that xNOR and xNOR are NOT gates.

For these equations, the OR operation is equivalent to XOR as both operators are logical OR. Note that xNOR can be implemented using two xNOT gates and two XNOR gates each of which can be implemented using one xOR gate and an inverter.

For the QXNOR gate to be implemented (i.e., the right-hand side of the gate is not inverted), we have the following set of equations. Note that xNOR can be implemented as a NOT gate using twoNOT gates and an inverter.

In conclusion, a logical NOR gate can be implemented using four XOR gates (the last two of which are not).

Quantum Logic Gates in a Multi-Qubit Model

Next, we will define a two-qubit quantum OR and XOR gates similar to the NOT gate and its conjugate.

Q: A state in two-dimensional Hilbert space,

a state represented by vector state σ, and

a measurement result.

For unitary operations, [0⊗0⊗0⊗−1] states are the states where the second element, [0,0,1,0] is unity and the first two components, [0,1,−1, 0] is zero. The measurements result are zero, one, and two, represented by the vector [1,0,0,0], …, [0,0,0,1], …, [0,0,1,0], ….

Fig. 1. CNOT

Fig. 2. A Quantum operation

Fig. 2 shows how the CNOT gate is defined. The first multiplication line applies the operation to a qubit (2). The second multiplication line applies the operation to an ancillary qubit called the control qubit (3). The first multiplication line is called the CNOT gate. The second multiplication line is the control qubit operation.

Fig. 3. Quantum operation definition

Each of these four lines is called a qubit line. The CNOT gate can be represented by a set of qubits of which each qubit performs a particular operation. The set of qubits can be represented by four vectors of values [−0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], [0,0.5,-0.5,0.5], [0,0,0.5,-0.5], if the system is operated on by the CNOT in sequence that results in the state of one qubit and in the value −1 for the control qubit and in the value 0 for the qubit one. The CNOT operation is one of the two distinct operations that can be performed on a quantum computer. It consists in a series of operations using different types of quantum devices such as a quantum gate or a set of qubits in the circuit. The set of these gates and quantum gates is called the CNOT gate set.

Figure 1. CNOT

Fig. 4. Controlled-NOT operation

The CNOT gate also can be represented by two qubits of which both qubits have the same basis, that is, an orthogonal basis. In the description of the operation, the qubits have different basis. Th
us the CNOT gate can be represented by the two terms [−0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], [0,0.5,-0.5,0.5], [1,0,0,0]. The operator used to apply this two-qubit operation is called the Controlled-NOT (‖C-NOT‖). The second term is a two-qubit operation and the basis is used to describe qubits of a set or in the formula of the gate set. As the CNOT can be represented by [−−−−−−−−] as in FIG. 4, the CNOT gate can be represented by two qubits of which both qubits have the same basis, that is, an orthogonal basis. In its description the qubits have different basis. Thus the controlled-not is a two qubit operation and the basis is called a Controlled-Not basis, it is also called Controlled Not for short. The operator used to apply this two-qubit operation is called Controlled-Not(‖C-NOT‖). The controlled-not operation allows one to apply a CNOT to a control qubit with the property that in such a case the control qubit is in one state instead of in two states. The two terms are the expressions used to represent three-qubit operations that can be represented by a controlled-NOT gate operation (see Fig. 5).

Fig. 5. Controlled-NOT operation

From the first term [−0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5] on one qubit is read as −0.5 and the second term [0,0.5,-0.5,0.5], one qubit is read as = 0.5, the expression for the second qubit is then −0.5 and the third bit is read as 0. So the controlled-not operation turns a state such as [−0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5] into a state such as [0,0.5,0.5,0.5]. The control qubit state is a mixed state (all the qubits of the state become pure) such that the third qubit, the mixed state is −1.

Let σ* be a state that represents the controlled-not operation. As all the bits of the quantum computation are represented by one qubit, we can apply a controlled-not operation to a single qubit σ. It is possible to transform any state into the controlled-not state σ*. For example, if the states of a superposition of two pure states ρ1 and ρ2, denoted by ρ (ρ1,ρ2), can be represented by either ρ1 or ρ2
or both ρ1 and ρ2, the result for any one qubit can be either ρ1 or ρ2. However, if we want a product of two states, say ρ1 (ρ2) and thus we want to apply ρ1 to a qubit where a measurement would result in the state =0, we can apply the controlled-not with the state σ. If the state σ satisfies the condition σ⊗ σ* = σ, then σ is a classical variable, representing as a state by θ^(σ)* that can by applied to a classical state as a quantum operation. If σ* is a mixed state, then σ* = σ^+ = σ^+, where |σ^+| = σ^+ |σ^+|. If we apply a controlled-NOT gate for a set of quantum states, then σ^+ and σ^+ are mixed states with σ^+ = σ*^+, where |σ^+| = |σ^+|.

To define the controlled-NOT gate set, we need to assign a basis to the qubits that can be represented by the expressions [−−−−−−−|0⊗0⊗−1⊗0⊗−1⊗1⊗0⊗−1⊗0⊗−1⊗
perations are required for that which is described through the probability of accepting or rejecting that quantum result (e.g., the operation A or A1 = R6 or A1 = L6 is required to accept probabilistically the outputs of qubit 2 and qubit 1 for the CNOT circuit. This is known as the probabilistic operation). These operations are the logical gate operations that are used for both CNOT gate and OR gate.

So far we have defined the CNOT gate basis R6 and L12 as the two bases used to build up the product matrix A1 ⊗ A2 = S2 and A3 ⊗ A5 = S2. In order to simplify these terms the following can be derived by the following process. First is the operation C2 on qubit 2, A2 ◑ B2, A3 ⊑ B3. As it has to take into account the probabilistic operation of a qubit it is necessary to write the product matrix A1 ⊗ A2 = A1 B2 ◑ A2 + A1−1 B2 + A3 B3 = S2, as shown in table 1. Second is the operation of A3 ◑ B3, A2 ⊗ B3 + A3 ⊗ B2 = S3 as it is not considered as a product matrix. The operation A3 ⊗ B3 can change the state of qubit 3 by the probabilistic operation A3 ⊗ B3 = C2. Third is the operation A3 ⊗ B2, A3 ⊗ B3. This operation accepts a probabilistic outcome when the state of qubit 3 is affected through the CNOT gate A3 ⊗ B2 = R4, then the state is C2 and the probabilistic outcome is accepted (A3 ⊗ B2 on qubit 3 and so B3 in qubit 2). However when qubit 3 is involved there is an operation that ac
cepts a probabilistic outcome by the operation A3 ⊗ B2 on qubit 3 and the probabilistic outcome is accepted. By setting the qubits Q1 and Q2 the probabilistic effects are cancelled and the CNOT gate has taken into account so the probabilistic operation in C− does not take into account the actual state of Q1 and Q2 during the operation A3 ⊗ B2. The operation A3 ⊗ B1 and A3 ⊗ B2 which are shown in figure 2 are the probabilistic operation A3 ⊗ B3 and C3, respectively, and A3 ⊗ B1 is not considered as a probabilistic operation and A3 ⊗ B2 is not considered as a probabilistic operation as all they have were in the previous process. Finally, for the operation of A1 ◑ A3 = H1H3H1H3, the operation will be considered from only one qubit and is considered in the A1 ⊗ A3 = S2 = H1H3H1H3 = A3 ⊗ A5 = S2.

Quit the quantum computer using a single qubit, let the computer start the operation, and then you can check the correctness of the program by running it on another quantum computer.

The CNOT gate C− has two different modes of operation, depending on how a qubit of the quantum computer is involved. If a probabilistic operation were to take place on a single qubit, the operation becomes: (1) the probabilistic operation in C− and so C − as shown in the second part of the CNOT gate matrix A5 = S2 and then is taken into account and is ignored in the final value of the CNOT matrix A5 = S2, or (2) the probabilistic operation A 5 ⊗ A 2 = = 1 where A 5 = S2. To implement either mode of operation an operation on only one qubit is required.

The CNOT gate can be modified by connecting qubits for the operation A 5 ⊗ A 3 with different values of C 3 through C
circuit theory. They are the basic building blocks of any quantum circuit. Quantum gates are not the same as gates that may be constructed by humans if we use the right building blocks. There are two types of gates: classical gates and quantum gates. A quantum gate, shown in Figure 1 and called an AND gate, is an operation where at least one of the two input qubits is the logical bit (1 or 0) while the other input qubit changes to a lower energy state, called the measurement state, depending on the value of the second input qubit. In Figure 2, we can see a quantum gate. There are quantum gates that will be useful to us, but there are a number of classical gates that will also be useful to us, such as a bit flip. The quantum gate gates are the ones which allow one or more quantum processes to be implemented, such as quantum teleportation, quantum error correction, computation with long-range entanglement, etc. At first, when we are discussing computations with classical devices, we make a distinction between quantum circuit functions and computation functions. In computational devices, the quantum process or computation process is simply one operation, while at the same time we are computing a result. When we do this for both types of devices, we can refer to these operations as a quantum circuit, and these operations are called gates in quantum circuit theory. In contrast, when we are discussing quantum phenomena, we are talking about operations in quantum devices and classical devices at the same time. In quantum computing, the quantum process is the computer. All the devices that you use, like the quantum gate example shown in Figure 2, are the computers inside the device that you are using. When we are describing quantum computation or operations, it makes sense to talk about devices that are the computers in the devices that we are using. A quantum computation is simply one single, large program, as shown in Figure 3, where each state represents an operation. T
hus, the state is like the program or data, and is usually written in higher-level information representations which we will describe in greater detail in the next chapter. Let’s see how we can apply our Quantum Math to both quantum computation and quantum  circuit and its function. A quantum computation is one single very large program. While there’s still the possibility we can have several intermediate steps or processes involved in implementing these large computations. They can include processes of the form shown in Figure 4, which are also called quantum gates. These are also called “hardware functions” because they are implemented by a quantum device. A quantum gate gate is an operation where at least one of the two input qubits is the logical bit “1”, while the other input qubit changes to a lower energy state “0”. In this example, the “0” in the measurement state corresponds to a “0” in the logical “1”. Here’s another example: a quantum process like the quantum gate shown in Figure 2, where the first qubit state changes from a “0” to a state of a measurement state. In this case, the “0” in the measurement state represents a “0” in the logical “1”. These gates are often denoted as quantum gates. Although there really are only two types of gates (for both types of devices and both types of operation), we can use the term “quantum gate” in the context of quantum circuits to refer to any device that one can place between the input qubits, such as a quantum gate which has a function of changing the qubit to a measurement state. A quantum gate is a part of the physical process in quantum computations and operations in terms of one or more qubits changing to a new state. A physical device called a gate is a part of the physical processes in quantum circuits that are implementing quantum computations and operations. A quantum gate performs a calculation in a particular configuration (e.g. a logical one, or a measurement) which is a part of the physical procedure in
quantum circuits that is being performed in order to implement a computation, and this is often called a computational process in quantum computation. In quantum circuits, there are many devices to perform computations that we will discuss here. A computation can be divided into two parts: logic gates and measurement processes performed on the quantum gate. Many devices are being used in quantum computers to perform several operations in parallel. The quantum gate can make its way to logic gates or measurement processes. Thus, for a quantum gate, it is not a part of a single computation, but a process of a number of computations. Since there are various devices and quantum gates that can go through a computation process, the computational process is sometimes defined in terms of the output results, but for now let’s limit our discussion to the computational process only. A computation process, shown in Figure 5, is a procedure in a quantum gate that is part of a computational process. Now we can take an example, like the computation process shown in Figure 5, and discuss a number of quantum gates and quantum effects. Quantum effects can be further divided into two groups: decoherence and coherence. Since we are taking a more classical view of classical computers as they are used in quantum computing, we will look at decoherence first, followed by coherence later. A quantum gate can interact with other quantum gates, such as other quantum gates and classical gates, and it’s part of a computation process in quantum  computation. The gate which controls the behavior and can be regarded as a quantum gate is called a gate. There are a number of classical gates called gates that function on quantum states. An operation or “gate” in the classical world is called a function in computer science. Although the logical state and the measurement state are fundamental to a computation, a logical operation is also an operation on quantum states, but is not a function on them. Cla
ssical functions are functions in the classical world, and it is useful to consider the two worlds together. For example, we might say that a function is defined as a quantum gate that performs a computation. The gates may not have to do anything with quantum states at all. A function in the classical world is a simple function, which does not make any measurements at all. A function can be applied one time to each quantum state. But it can also be applied over each single quantum state that makes up a quantum gate. A quantum gate can perform in two different operations: AND, or not AND, and NAND, or not NAND. Some of the gates we will describe in the next few sections of this chapter are just NOT gates, and some other gates may perform multiple operations at the same time (that is, AND gates can be implemented by both NOT gates and NAND gates, for example). There is a subtle difference between a NOT gate and a NAND gate. A NOT gate does NOT a quantum state whether it’s the logical “0” or the logical “1” in the gate. But a NAND gate DOES NOT a quantum state whether it’s the logical “0” or the logical “1” in the gate. A NOT gate AND a NAND gate only takes the logical AND of two quantum states into account, while

"0 + no classical information, for example, you can see a logical bit is   or. In this example, a logical 1 (a qubit) is a bit "0",  and  A logical 0 (a qubit) is not a bit "0". These states and operators can be understood as an electron in semiconductor and are related to the qubit states and operations. Using the logical qubit and logical operations, a logical input state will either be a logical 0 or logical 1. A classical logic 1 or 0 is a measurement 0 or 1. If the logical state is a 0, the measurement is a 0. If the logical state is 1, the measurement is a 1. These two logical states form both the quantum state and a classical measurement. It can also be a classical input state (a quantum state at classical time ). Quantum states can be thought of as being like the wave functions of electrons. Unlike the eigenstates of the Pauli exclusion principle, which only represent discrete numbers of particles, quantum states represent the discrete quantum information and represent the states at the time and location. When a measurement is performed, the states of the system change into either a quantum state or a classical measurement state. This can occur by a measurement at some time, for example measurements in qubit qubits. A measurement at a qubit introduces a time dependent state transition that is not in contrast with the transition that occurs when the logical qubit is a 0 or 1 on classical digital logic. Measurement is an important concept when considering the state-to-state information transfer described in quantum information, because qubits can represent the state of an entire system. For example, the logical bit in a quantum gate can be interpreted as a 1 or 0. When considering how a gate might be implemented, it is the 1 or 0 in the qubit that provides the initial quantum state and a measurement. A quantum computer consists of many quantum bits, each of which is a two-qubit quantum gate with two inputs and two outputs, that are connected together to form
a larger quantum computer. This quantum computer needs to be connected to an external quantum computer to operate, as we would not be able to solve large problems on-the-go with this architecture. It also means that some amount of work must be performed on the external quantum computer for the qubits to work properly with the external computation engine. The external processor also needs to be able to perform tasks that the quantum computer that's connected to it is unable to perform. For example, quantum computation is best suited to performing quantum logic operations that are hard to predict using classical logic. When two qubits are connected, they can be thought of as consisting of quantum bits. The physical dimensions can be two or three qubits. For example, one 3-qutrit quantum bit,  would be a  logical qubit composed of the logical 1 and 2 states, and this can be described as  and  The logical state of an unknown quantum state will have a probability of being 0. If the probability would be 1, this implies that the unknown state in the quantum state has the potential to be a classical state, but a classical state with a probability of 1 and a classical state with a probability of 0 is not the same thing. For simplicity, we will not use the word classical state here. Rather, we will refer to non-coherent states of the quantum state as quantum states or states of the form  Then a measurement of qubit state will be performed. The measurement can result in classical output  if the unknown is in a classical state

Quantum bits can be represented as a particle of 2 or 3 qubits which interact with external electromagnetic fields. Each of the states will have an equivalent probability of being 0 or 1, where 0 means no quantum information and 1 means a known quantum information. Thus, by analogy in other quantum processes the logical qubit can be thought of as consisting of a particle of two 2 qutrit particles which interact with the quantum states of an external quan
tum system. The external device can consist of: A quantum processor connected to an external processor or device that performs quantum calculations on the input quantum data represented by external quantum data. For example, a quantum processor can be used for quantum logic operations where it would perform logical operations on the state of a qubit, then read the state of a larger quantum processor. If the quantum logic operations are complex calculations, a quantum gate might be used to perform a logical 0 or a 1 in the quantum state represented by an external quantum system, but in the quantum system itself the "0" or "1" is just the value of quantum information represented by that quantum data (and not the quantum state of the quantum data).

The qubit logic or quantum logic operation is a logical operation on the states of a qubit. In the quantum circuit, the logic circuit transforms the state of the external quantum processor into the state of an internal logical processor. The gates are the operations that are used to create or manipulate a logical qubit in the quantum circuit with the external quantum processor. The logic operation is represented by logical operators on the state of the logical qubit. The logical operation on the quantum data is the same as the logic operations that are performed on the quantum data in the quantum circuit. To perform a logical operation on the qubit, a circuit is called a logical circuit and a logical circuit consists of a set of gates that connect the qubits together.

Types of gates
To perform a logical operation on the quantum data represented by the external quantum system, logical gates are used. These gates are two-qubit gates that can be understood to transform either the logical 0 or logical 1 in the quantum data to a logical 0 or 1. A logical 0 is a classical state. A logical 1 is a classical state. A logical 0 is not a classical state. A logical 1 can represent the classical state. But other types of gates are not
logical gates. They are called quantum gates. Quantum gates are two-qubit gates that are not classical gates, so they cannot transform a classical bit into a classical state nor a classical state into a classical bit.

The logical zero is represented by the logical AND gate. The logical ones are represented by the logical OR gate. The logical NAND gate is the logical XOR gate. The logical negation is the logical XNOR gate. Thus, all three gates are two-qubit gates. Two qubits interacting with each other will have a state of either 0 or 1. For example,   and  are also two-qubit logical 0 and 1, respectively. However,   and  are also two qubits entangled with each other because they have the same state. Therefore, the three gates are two-qubit gates. The logical XOR gate acts on the quantum state represented by qubit 1 with qubit 2 and has the effect of reversing the values of the qubits. With two qubits in the same state, both qubits will have the same value:   and. Therefore, the logical XOR gate is a two-qubit gate. When both qubits are in a state of 0 and one is in a state of 1, the qubit will have a zero value if the other
or CNOT form. The CNOT gate can be used to perform certain computational tasks when the gates are applied and it is an important type of quantum gate that can be used to perform certain quantum computational tasks. Another important type of quantum gate, which is not a unitary gate itself, but a probabilistic operation, is the EPR gate. The operation of the EPR gate is described by the EPR-channel or the EPR-channel form. An EPR-channel is a unitary transformation of a collection of single-electron states to an entangled channel or state that is described by a set of EPR’s.

Unitary operation on quantum state quantum computer

In a one-qubit unitary operation on a quantum system, you change the quantum state of one particle and you change its state simultaneously. This can be represented by the following equation:

(12)

where

(12)

If

, it means that if state (11) has the state then we can change the state of the system to the state (12) and we can’t do that because (11) has the state and state (12) doesn’t have the state. If you perform a one-qubit unitary operation on other particles in the quantum system, you can change its state. If you perform a one-qubit unitary operation on the whole quantum system, all the particles in the quantum system will be in one unchanged state. If one of the particles in the quantum system is changed then the state of the entire system changes. This is the same as performing a measurement for a quantum system, where the measurement result determines the state of the whole quantum system. In the classical world there is no one-qubit operation that can change its state at the same time, but if the quantum state of the system is changed, it can be measured at the same time. When two particles that are in the same state are in the quantum system, their states can be changed by performing a one-qubit unitary operation. In the classical world, these operations are called a Bell measurement and a CSL measurement. (13)

A unitary operati
on means that you are changing the state of one particle at the same time it changes the state of another particle. If one particle is changed then the other particle’s state changes. Therefore if you perform a CSL measurement, the result is a CSL measurement on each particle. (14)

The quantum operators are the transformations that make physical quantities like energy change, that’s called transformation. A general mathematical operation, like a mathematical operation on the vector space we are using, changes the basis vectors of this space over some fixed basis. For example, if

and

then

By the quantum operator notation, we just get a scalar product (i.e. a non-zero constant).

Here is a list of the most commonly used quantum operators.

1. Hermitian conjugate. It is a quantum operation that when applied a Hermitian operator will change the magnitude of the operator. The Hermitian conjugate of a matrix whose rows are operators is a matrix whose the columns are Hermitian operators. For example, the matrix

is called a non-Hermitian matrix.

2. We have 2 two Hermitian matrices. It is a quantum operation that when applied

will change this matrix into this matrix’s inverse (see below).

3. The CNOT is a quantum operation that when applied a CNOT operator on qubits will change the states of all qubits in the quantum. It is a particular type of quantum gate.

The CNOT gate can be represented by the following equation:

A CNOT gate is a set of quantum gates that by themselves can not change the state of the system since their action on each of the qubits would not result in it changing the state of those qubits. However, when combined with a unitary operation they can change the state of the system. (15)

A CNOT gate operation takes the form

and is called a CNOT gate.

4. The CNOT is a quantum operation that when applied to two qubits will change both qubits’ states. For example let us look at this operation:

If we apply this to the two qubits

 we get the following
:

(16)

where

(16)

The CNOT gate is the quantum operation that when applied can change the state of a single qubit of a quantum into a state that has the state of the entire system. This is the transformation operation that a general unitary operation is a quantum operation. That is why a CNOT gate is called a transformation operation.

5. The EPR-channel is a quantum channel that by itself can not change the state of the system. But when you apply a EPR channel to qubits in a closed quantum system (which is like a quantum state machine), then all the qubits in the system are changed states. Since a EPR channel is a single type of channel the EPR-channel can only take a single type of channel, and the EPR-channel is called a single-type of channel. The EPR-channel takes as input

, and it outputs

. The EPR-channel will output all the information that can be stored in the qubits in the EPR-channel can take as input the single kind of information that can be stored in the qubits (i.e. all the information stored in all the qubits). If we think of 2 qubits at the same time we can’t measure the second and we can’t measure the last, and we can’t change the state of the entire quantum system.

The EPR-channel is similar to a quantum state machine, where the EPR-channel takes as input

, and it outputs

, where

The EPR-channel acts on two qubits simultaneously so it can take as input

, and it outputs

, where

It can only take a single qubit as input. This is how CNOT gates and the EPR-channel can work. If a qubit is changed then the other qubit changes. A CNOT gate can be seen as the operation of two CNOT gates that can only take the form. However a EPR-channel can take as an input any qubit state. CNOT gates and EPR-channels can be used to create entanglement that can be used by other quantum computations. The EPR-channel is an important example of a particular type of single-type of channel used for quantum communications. (19)

Quantum operations are always descri
bed in the classical world. If the operation is applied or measured (i.e.

), the result cannot be predicted in the classical world. This means that operations that are performed in the classical world are not
= +1 and A2 ⊗ B2 = −1 to give R10 = 2I−1. However, R10 ⊗ B10 = 3I−1 + 1I⊗−1 to give I5 = 3I−1−1 and because A7 = 0, A5 ⊗ B5 = I⊗−1 = I⊗+1. Note that, if I2 = ±I⊗−1, then a qubit in phase 1 can also be represented by I−1+I1 = a−b and a+b = a+a∗. The probabilistic operation for both the qubit 2 and qubit 3 are: A1 ⊗ B1 = R10⊗ L10 = I∗−1. The probabilistic operation for qubit 4 is A5 ⊗ B5 = I⊗−1⊗−1 and for qubit 5 is A1 ⊗ B1 = R7⊗L7 = I⊗2⊗−1. The probabilistic operation for qubit 6 is A3 ⊗ B3 = I⊗1+1 from A1 and A3. However, R9⊗ −R10 = √R9 + √R10 = 2A10 = 2I−2 and the probability of accepting a probabilistic outcome in the qubit 6 is P6 = P3+pq1+pq2 where pq1 is the probability that a state after performing the CNOT gate operation is R8 = R−2⊗L8 = C10⊗ L10′ = R10 and pq2 is the probability that a state before performing the CNOT gate operation is R9 = L9 = R−2⊗L9 = C9+p⊗R10′ = C10⊗ L10. Since R6 is formed from R12 = ± 2I−1, R12 = 0 for the qubit 4 and R6 = −1 for qubit 5 and the probabilistic operation of the qubits 2,4 and 2, 5, is R12 = 0, P2 = −2 and R12 = p2 for qubits 4 and 5. Similarly, in the qubit 3, R12 = C2 for qubit 2, q3 = −2 and C2 = p2−q3 for qubit 3 and R12 = 0 and P3 = −2 for qubit 2, q2 = 0 and C2 = −√2 for qubit 3 and P3 = −2 for qubit 4.

Here we find out the probabilistic operation of qubit 6 using three probabilistic operations: probabilistic operation of qubit 4, probabilistic operation of qubit 5, and probabilistic
vernacular of the digital realm. For example, to pass a digit from one place to another, you type in 0 or 1. Each time you pass 0 or a 1, you create a new bit that you store. At the most basic level, when you pass a first digit 0, you create this 0. In other words, you create an 1. You can add 1 to both 0 and 1 in binary, since both 0 and 1 can be 0 and 1. A first bit 0 is an individual bit. A first bit 1 is also an individual bit. 0 and 1 are not independent. There are two different binary expansions that you can work with. 0 is binary expansion 0, 1 is the one expansion that you make up to create a 1. First you can flip a 1 into a 0, and then you can create a 1 from a 0 with 1. You can then convert the 0 back into a 1 with an 0. You have used the binary expansion 0 in an array. You can create 2 bit arrays. 0 is 2 bit array 0, 1 is 2bit 2 array 0, 2 is 2 bit array 0, 3 is 3 bit array 0, 4 is 4 bit array 0, 5 is 5 bit array 001, 6 is 6 bit array 0000, etc. What are you actually doing with what you've just built. Well, you have been building an array in the first place. You've then built a single bit array with a final state of 0 (0 is an array, and 0 is a 1). There are a couple of advantages to arrays. First, you can easily make an array for a large number of bits. You can simply take bits from 0 to 0 million, then take some of those bits and turn them into 0 bits with a 1. So you have that huge bit array, and at each step you simply put a 1 on a 0. Now you have a single bit array, and it works great. The downside, though, is when you only store a single bit into the array, you can easily access bits from 0 to 0 million at the same time. That's a problem if you want to do some computation, but not because you can do a lot of computation with a single bit. First of all you can't make an array for 256 bits, because you are working with 4 bits at 1 bit per bit. To do computations with a 256 bit array, you would need to store them in the array 256 times. And that makes
the problem even worse, because you are only storing one element of the 2-dimensional array, where 256 is an even number. You can't use the 128, 256, 128 bit array of our previous example because you only have a 256-bit array stored. It is a problem for all applications of a quantum computer, but on the other hand, it's a problem for the next best system. For a quantum gate, it's a problem, but not because you store 256 states. The 256 states is just not enough for that. Instead, you create a quantum gate where you store 4 states and 4 bits per state. A classical gate is basically the same as a quantum gate, except it only has 4 bit and 4 states, and it can only move one of those states at a time. You create a classical gate where you store 4 bits and 4 states and you create a classical gate with a quantum gate which has 4 bit, 4 states, 4 qubits, and stores 4 bits per state and 4 quantum gates per state. You can store them in a large number of classical bits. A classical gate can be created that can do a 2-bit thing for example by taking two 0s and flipping them, and a classical gate in the same way as above can create two bits by taking a 0 and flipping it, or to create a 1 and flipping it. With both gates using the same quantum computation resources you have all the power of a classical gate to create all kinds of computational power. There are all kinds of useful computational power that a classical gate can compute. To give you an idea of how many computational power is actually possible, look at the above circuit. What would it do? It would do: take two 0s, 2 1s, flip them, then flip two 0, 1s into a 1 and turn two 1s into 1s. It would do all the 3-bit-and-4-bit computation that one classical function could perform. That's exactly the same as a quantum gate. There are a couple of questions that we have left unanswered. What quantum logic gates are there if you are modeling a quantum gate that has 4 bit and 4 states? A quantum gate has 4 bit, but it also has 4
states. There are three classes of gates, called 3-qubit gates, 4-qubit gates, and 6-qubit gates. 3 qubit gates have three qubits, which they can use more than one of. All of these gates have four states (which is just one state in the classical state space). That means that if you want to use a quantum gate that can do more than one or two applications, it must be more powerful than a gate like 3 qubit or 4 qubit. The quantum gates that will be discussed in the following are the 3-qubit gates, 4-qubit gates, and 6-qubit gates. The 3-qubit gates are the bitwise add, logical AND, and OR. If you make that logical AND, you have four possible outcomes: there are only two possibilities because we have two of them working together. Now, when you perform an AND, you have four possible outcomes: there are five possibilities. In each of those outcomes there are two 1s (remember binary, we can add 1 by just flipping a 1 into a 0). So it can be done either way. But in any of those 5 outcomes, there is only one possible outcome. So you can always be certain that the output of the AND operation is always two ones (0 or 1) and always one 0. That's the logical AND gate. The logical AND gates are not the only gates that make 3-qubit gates work. In a typical 3-qubit gate, all the four qubits are entangled with each other. In this way, you can use 3-qubit gates to create a two qubit gate that has four qubits. 3 qubit gates can also be called X gate. We will take a look at what happens by looking at these gates, because these are the gates that will be relevant. It is important to remember that although we are modeling the 3-qubit gates and 4-qubit gates here as gates, the terminology is not limited to just the 3-qubit gates. We can have 4-qubit, 6-qubit, 8-qubit gates using the same 3-qubit gates. So we are interested in 3 qubit gates, and these are basically the same as a 3 qubit gate. There are more gates than 3 qubit gates, but what's important to understand about gates is that th
ey can and have been used on more than 2 bits at a time. The four qubits in the 3 qubit gate is a 4 qubit. 4-qubit gates are a kind of gate, the most powerful kind, that has been used on more than 2 bits at a time
bit of 0 or 1 and a 1 or 0 measurement operator). A qubit that was initially “up” and the measurement operation on the qubit has no effect will be in the state with a 1 in the measurement operator. Therefore, the qubit becomes in the state “up” after the measurement operation is performed on an “up” qubit; and that is encoded as a “0” in the bit. Another qubit that was initially “down” will be in the state “down” as the measurement operation has no effect on this qubit. Both of these qubits become “down” (because the measurement operations have no effect on the state). In the same manner, a gate operation will flip a qubit and a gate operation performs a Boolean operation as opposed to merely the operation of the qubit. In this process a non-unitary operation is performed between qubits. In the example of a digital signal processing operation, a Hadamard gate may be a non-unitary operation that is represented by the gate operation. A Hadamard gate takes two qubits and inverts the one of the qubits (or the bit state for the other or nullary bit) without changing the other qubit.

Quantum computers can be made by a physical circuit, where a set of physical qubits is coupled and measured. A particular physical circuit quantum computer depends on the quantumness of the physical qubits, the operation of the physical qubit, the measurement interaction of qubits, other qubits and the measurement interaction of other qubits. There are several fundamental questions that this section will address: is it possible to find a physical structure in the mathematical space of density-matrix elements that has all of the above features? Is it possible to construct a physical structure with all of the above features without any use of the mathematics of quantum mechanics? What physical features for a quantum computer does quantum mechanics and non-unitary evolution have in common? Is there a quantum circuit that can be made with only two physical qubits?

The question of the physical
features in some special cases that quantum mechanics and non-unitary evolution have in common is called superposition of quantum states. If all the qubits in a physical system is quantum in nature then the quantum state of the whole system can be said to be “in superposition” and the whole quantum state can be said to be “in state superposition”. If the quantum state of one qubit only is quantum, then only the quantum state of one of the qubits can be called “in superposition” as opposed to “in state superposition” where the quantum state of all qubits could be said to be “in state superposition”. In an N’-qubit system it is possible that the quantum state of one qubit is “in superposition”, but not all N’ qubits are in a “superposition”.

A quantum circuit is a set of quantum circuits, the physical qubits that are used to encode quantum information. This physical qubits may be single qubits or could also be larger collections of many qubits. A quantum circuit can be implemented by the use of quantum gates. A quantum circuit has a circuit element and a set of control gates. A circuit element is the structure of the quantum circuit. The elements of the circuit are composed of more that one quantum gates. A quantum gate is a set of quantum gates consisting of quantum operations. There can be many different types of quantum gates, although it may not be possible to describe and classify all. Quantum gates can perform a quantum operation that can be performed on an arbitrary quantum state of the system. Quantum gates, while being quantum, may not be able to perform the full set of operations required by quantum mechanical physics. A qubit does not exist in a “superposition” just an “entangled” state in which more than two “0” and “1” states are possible. If all quantum states were possible then there would be “entangled states” that could not be discriminated as they would consist of all “0” states. However, qubits are actually not in a “superposition”, they are in “en
tangled states” because they are just one qubit and a single set of quantum operations can’t perform “superposition” more than two “0” and “1” states. In order to distinguish between quantum states and non-quantum states we can speak about “entanglement”.

The word quantum is based upon the Greek word ὤν. The word “quantum” is based upon the Arabic ikhtaqa meaning three. According to the Latin word quid meaning “something” (as defined by the French language) the word “quantum” means “unusual”. It also follows Greek origin, which is the Latin word kata as opposed to the word kata meaning “chance”.

In order for a physical circuit to be physical, it must have three dimensions. Quantum circuits as we have them today can be only three dimensional. This may be a limitation of the current technology, including the ability to make quantum circuit quantum computers with higher numbers of physical qubits. A circuit can perform a quantum operation as if it had five dimensions.

A quantum circuit is only two dimensional when it is composed of two physical qubits. However, many quantum circuit quantum computers are actually three dimensional. That is, they are not two dimensional quantum circuits composed of two physical qubits. There are special reasons quantum circuits could be physically three dimensional. For example, the two dimensional quantum circuit can be implemented by an array of physical qubits. Another way to build three dimensional quantum circuits is to use a 3D network of more than two qubits. There are physical problems to build a circuit out of quantum hardware with higher dimensional quantum hardware. This is a topic that is not necessary for this explanation and should be a separate topic, unless otherwise noted.

A quantum circuit can be implemented using physical qubits and two other qubits that are referred to as ‘auxiliary’ qubits. A quantum circuit can also be implemented using one of many possible physical states of each of the three ‘auxiliary’ qubits
. The three ‘auxiliary’ qubits can, or may not, be entangled with a quantum state. The physical device for implementing a quantum circuit with only three physical qubits that has other qubits as auxiliary qubits uses the same technology that has been developed to construct quantum circuits with higher dimensional quantum circuits. When the three physical qubits share a entangled quantum state with the auxiliary qubits the final state will be determined by the quantum circuit for the three physical qubits, not by the quantum circuit in the auxiliary qubits. If each physical qubit is entangled with the auxiliary qubits then there is the potential that the physical circuits built out of the three physical qubits will not have �
basis  (in the second step this is called the  CNOT operation). The Pauli matrices P, − P correspond to the basis {1; −1; 0}. The CNOT gate, Pauli matrices and their representations are known as  the  CNOT gate,  the Pauli matrices  and  the  basis or  the Pauli matrices. For a non-commutative group the non-commutative operation is also called the quantum logic gate or the quantum or quantum gate which can be represented in CNOT like notation.

Figure 1 -  Quantum gate operations
A physical qubit can be represented as a three-state vector that changes to another three-state vector depending on the measurement operator. This is called the quantum logic gate. This transformation is used to measure and to rotate the states of two qubits independently of each other and is not reversible. This non-commutative or non-unitary operation can be represented like this:

{

(where the bar means that the state is changing)

}=

{

(in the third equation)

}=

{

(the following two equations)

}= {

}={

{

}

}

These results are obtained by means of an orthogonal projection and a linear operator that measures the position and the momentum of one of the two qubits. In fact a logical unitary operation that changes the state of a qubit that only depends on a position measurement is called a Pauli operator.

The simplest experiment that can be performed in a quantum computer on a two-qubit register consists of measuring the first qubit with P and then measuring the second qubit with − P. The result of this measurement is the result of the measurement given by the Pauli operator that is obtained when P is used in equation (1).

This Pauli measurement is just an example of the unitary operation, the basis or representation is the basis states [0; 1; 0]. Pauli  and the Pauli operators correspond to three different types of measurement operations, for example:

For a non-commutative group the two non-commutative operations that can be applied are a Pauli operator, and an operator that
accepts only one of the two possible measurement results. As a rule of quantum computing operations using the Pauli operator only have one fixed measurement outcome and are thus called the Pauli operation. The first two qubits must be entangled and the qubits need to be in the same state before performing the Pauli measurement. This is the requirement to perform a Pauli measurement. The same measurement is also performed when performing a general logical operator, and called a logical operation or operation that applies the result of the measurement in the form −1 or 0. A logical operation is used when one wants to make a measurement that doesn't accept only the value 0 or 1. A quantum gate or gate set can be composed from several different operators, like [i⊗j⊗k for instance] or [l⊗j⊗k for instance]. For this operation to be defined, it is needed that one of the qubits has to be in a different state before the operation that performs the logical operation. The operations that accept only an identity and a phase have to accept the identity of the measured qubit too. This logical operation must then be different on qubits of the same state. For this operation to be defined, the measurements must be performed on the qubits that can be either in the same or in a different state.

In a non-commutative quantum computer it is not possible to define a quantum gate or gate set because its gates have to be defined without any requirement on what the measurement is. In a quantum computer a gate or gate set has to be defined on two qubits. The gate or gate set is a mathematical operation that transforms a state into a different state of the system it acts. A gate or gate set is composed of operators, and by construction its gates are Hermitian. The Hermitian operator is the unitary operator that transforms the state of one qubit into the state of the other qubit. The unitary operator that transforms two qubits into two different states are known as the CNOT gate and in additi
on the non-unitary gates of the gate or gate set are described as operators in which the first and the second qubit are commuting with each other and in which there is a Pauli operator.

As an example of the operations which could be represented by a gate or gate set it is possible to represent the Hadamard gate that transforms a state of qbits with their logical states H or H+ into a different state of two qubits with the logical states H by means of c-phase.

It is possible to write the Hadamard gate by means of an operator that accepts the logical states H and H+ and transforms them into the logical states H+ and then the logical state H becomes a unitary (and a transformation through a CNOT gate) on the second qubit.

In the CNOT gate it is important to note that the first qubit always needs to be in the opposite state than the second qubit, and the logic operation can be defined without a requirement of the first qubit to be in the state of the second qubit. As an example it would be possible to transform qubits H and H+ with the CNOT gate and the logical operators H and not H by means of the following two steps:

(because qubit H is in the state H and qubit H+ is in the state H+, the first step becomes H→H+ H+).

A Hadamard gate that produces the unitary operation H→ H + can be written explicitly as the following formula:

The Hadamard gate with one qubit as input and one qubit as output is equal to the CNOT gate.

Two Hadamard transformations with two different qubits of the same state are represented by the following two steps:

(because both gates are the same on the first qubit).

It is very simple to understand the meaning of Hadamard or CNOT gates. If we imagine that the first qubit is in a state X and the second on H+ and the first output qubit we say that if we measure the first qubit after a Hadamard or CNOT operation the result will be in terms of state X or an opposite state of X like H→ H+ X H+. If we measure after an operation on the second qubit
before the Hadamard or CNOT operation the result will be in terms of one of the two states which is the same value of the first qubit and the result will be H, the same value or the inverse of the first result. Therefore, if we can measure first the first qubit we can perform an operation on the second qubit and convert it into one of the two possible values of states on its first qubit or we transform
he case of two qubits X & Y, X,Y,A1,A2 and Y,A3, which are shown in the figure. We can transform the qubit state Y,A3 to C2 as shown in the figure. The operator equation for X and Y of which the matrix S is shown below for the qubit state A3 to produce C2 is X ⊗ C2 = −I⊗L12 = +B3⊗B6 = L5⊗L5 = M0 = −M0 where I is the identity matrix S = A1 L12 = A3 B6 = Y A2 L10 = −Y A2, A1 = I, A2 = −1 while X ⊗ S = A1 ⊗B3 = A3 ⊗ B3 = −I⊗L12 = +B1 ⊗ B1 = −B1 ⊗ +B3 ⊗B5 = L5 ⊗ L5 = L−1 (A1 L12 = A3 B6 & Z = Y;) Z = −Y A2 L10 = −Y A2. (As we mentioned previously, the output Y of A2 will be the second qubit but if A2 is measured first then A2 will be the third qubit). Now X ⊗ C2 = −I⊗L12 = +B3⊗B6 = L5⊗L5 = M1 = −M1 and Y ⊗ C2 = −I⊗L12 = +B1 ⊗B1 = B1 + B2 = −B 2 = Y ⊗ −+ = − +−. Now S = −M0, A1 and A2 are measured and output Y is measured according to the following equations. We have Y ⊗ C2 = + B1 ⊗ B3 = B2 ⊗ B3 = + (−1+1+1) = B2 ⊗ + (−+− +−+−+) = − B1 ⊗ (−+− +−+−+) and A2 is measured and output Y ⊗ C2 = B1 ⊗ +B3 ⊗B5 = + B3 ⊗ −B5 B2 ⊗ ⊗ +B5 ⊗ +B6 ⊗ +B7 = + (B2 ⊗ + − + − +)⊗ (+) + (− B5 ⊗ + B7 ⊗ + B8 ⊗ + B9 ⊗ )= + (B2 ⊗ B5 + B2 + − B1 ⊗ − + B5 ⊗ B5 + B7 ⊗ B7 )= B2 ⊗ B5 + B2 + (−+ +− +−+ − +)) → Y ⊗ C2 = B1 ⊗ B3 = B3 ⊗ B3 = +−+ B3 ⊗B5 = + (−+− +−+ −+ +−) → − B1 ⊗ (−+ −++) → −− B1 ⊗ −− → − B2 ⊗B5 = − B5 ⊗ −− → − B3 ⊗B5 = +−+ B5 ⊗B7 = + B5 ⊗ B8 → + B2 ⊗B7 → − B2 ⊗ −− → B2 ⊗ B7 → ± B1 ⊗ B8 → ↑ ± B1 ⊗ B3 → ↑ ↑ ±↑ ↑ ↑ → ↑ ± ±↑ ↑ ↑ → ↑ ± ± ↑ ± ↑ ↑ → ↑ ± ± ↑ ± ↑ ↑ → ↑ ± ± ↑ ± ↑ ↑ → ↑ ±± ↑ ↑ → ↑ ±± ↑ ↑ → ↑ + ± ± –− → ↑ + +−+ → ↑ ++ ±± ↑ (+ + + + + + ++ ± ± +/- ++ + ± – − + + ± ± ++ ± ± −) → − + + − − → − + +−++ → − − − → −− − → −+− +−+ → − +−+ − → − − +−++ → − − − +≈ ± − ± ±± ± ±± ± ± ±+±±±± ± + ± ±±±± ± ± ± ± ± ±± ± + ±±±± ±± ± ♗ – ±± ± ± ± ± ± ±± ±± ± ± ± – ±± ± ±± ± /// ±± ± ± ± ±­±± ± ♗ ± ±± ± ­±± ±± ♗ ±± ± –±± ±– ±± ±± ♗ ±± ±± −± ± ±± ±± ±± ♗± ± ±±

have a binary value either 0 or 1. A classical gate on a classical computer is called a "NOT"-gate. The quantum gate operations, called "CNOT"-gates, are very similar, but are in a higher energy state for a given state. Here is a classical, CNOT-gate. A CNOT-gate can be represented as a combination of one classical circuit and a quantum gate. The circuit is an approximation of the circuit that would be created by the introduction of a new quantum gate. A quantum gate has only two input qubits, rather than the more complex multiple qubits used in a circuit (or even a whole circuit) where you have more or less 1 AND-gate, AND, XOR, NOT and more. There is no difference between the circuit that uses that method of gate creation and the circuit that uses a bunch of a few classical gates for the purpose of creating a new circuit. The quantum circuit that a quantum computer would use is really just a different approximation or realization of that same quantum gate for more efficient, less circuit resource consumption than if you were using the same gate to create the same circuit. A quantum gate on a quantum computing device can have a gate parameter that determines how the state of a quantum gate is distributed between the qubits, and the quantum gate will create a quantum state that is in a different energy state with a different value of the gate parameter. There are a number of gate parameter settings that can be used that differ depending on the context of the circuit. For example, the number of gates used could be set through a circuit parameter, like C(N(m)) instead of using one CNOT gate, and the gate parameter could be the state of one of the qubits. The gate parameter could also be some property of the quantum state, and the gates will only perform the operation on a subset of qubits (for example if the gate has the property p_p, the gates will only perform the operation on qubits with property p), while if the gate has the property, they will take the gate para
meter given by the property of the quantum state in the gate parameter, which allows for more efficient gate creation via the gate parameter. These parameter settings also can be controlled when a quantum circuit is simulated at run time using the gate parameter, just like a classical circuit parameter of the same strength would control how to simulate a classical circuit.

These parameters are represented by quantum gates in a circuit diagram. A gate diagram is a diagram that illustrates the gate operation in a circuit, and is a great way to see the flow of the gate operation during simulation. Let's start with looking at quantum gates on classical computers, and how that relates to how a quantum computer works. The quantum gate operations can be thought of as logical operators with a different power in a quantum gate, and they can be thought of as a mathematical circuit representing those logical operators, or they can just be a set of logical operators. To get a circuit going, we essentially begin with a set of logical operators that allow us to create the states of the qubits that we need to run the logical operators on. Then we perform a bit flip on one or more of the qubits, using some additional control parameters for the operation that change them to some lower state that has a lower energy. We complete the circuit then by taking the logical operators and applying them to the input qubits. We also define a new gate parameter that controls how gates affect the input qubits. So here is the circuit we use to start a quantum circuit. We use classical logic gates, or "NOT", gates and CNOT-gates, to create the quantum circuit. (NOTE: You can call these gates a "NOT"-gate, "CNOT"-gate, "XOR"-gate, or any other gates that are logical, i.e. NOT, AND, XOR, NOT, etc, but we are just referring to them as the logical gates). From the logical operators, we can create the inputs of the classical CNOT-gates (called control and target qubits in this case), and finally, we ad
d the classical qubits for the output gates to make up the quantum circuit. As an example, for the case of a 3 × 3 circuit that is used for a quantum gate, the following input circuit would be used to start the process. In this example, we have three logical operators (NOT, and AND), and a 3 × 3 CNOT-gate. First, we have three classical bits (labeled as 3). These could be bits or qubits, for the purposes of this discussion. Then we have a classical circuit that does a bit flip (-1) on each of these three classical inputs. These are the control qubits that are used for the gate operations. We define a gate parameter, that we call XOR, that can control the outputs of the CNOT-gates (3), but the qubits used as our target qubits (1 in this case). Finally we define another gate parameter that we call X, which is the gate parameter that controls how the qubits are used to control the operations on the various gates in a circuit. This gate parameter allows the different qubits from the input circuit to be applied to the gate parameters to create new gates to be used for specific parts of the circuit. X represents the gate operation on the qubit. So here is the example CNOT-gate used as our gate parameter for one of the gates in our circuit - it's using the control bit for its operation, and the target qubit it's applying to is the control qubit so the gate operation will effectively apply the other qubits on the target side of the qubit (the X gate). The left circuit shows the same three classical bits that we used, but with the new gate operations being applied on the new gate parameter, X. Note the different types of gates (NOT, AND, AND, XOR, NOT, etc) are represented. This model enables us to go beyond just using a binary representation of the operation of a state using quantum gates, to use quantum gate operations as an additional step in the circuit diagram to represent the quantum logic gates in our circuit, and they will make it more efficient to create the circuit
s. We can also think of this as an addition to the circuit itself, which makes adding new gate parameters more efficient. Since our main goal is to create quantum circuits, we'll use gates that the authors of Quantum Computers have used throughout their research. These are logical gates, and the "NOT", "AND", and "CNOT"-gates will be used as a starting point of our model for building more complex quantum gates. These gates work with the same principles that computers do, and can be used to help explain and visualize some of the complexities behind implementing quantum computing algorithms at run time. These gates are important because they are used as building blocks in quantum computing, and we'll discuss several different types of gates later on in the text to help us understand how they are different. So from here, we use the gate parameters to simulate and model quantum circuits, allowing us to more easily compare different quantum circuits.

Quantum Gates, Quantum Gates, Quantum Gates Quantum gates are an important part of today's computing because they allow computations to be performed in an efficient manner utilizing quantum phenomena. Today's computers use classical gates called "logical" operations to
in the following paragraph. The state of a quantum system can be represented by an operator of the form  where  is a ket plus a coefficient, e.g. a complex number. The measurement of the quantum system is obtained with the operation. The ket + complex number () is an operator which acts on the operators of the states and represents the state of the quantum system being described. The operator represents the state of the quantum system after a measurement. Hence, a  is an operator that provides the probability of the states after a measurement. The operator represents the measurement result in the quantum system. The operator (  is a nonlinear function that represents the measurement result in a quantum system, e.g. a logical state after a measurement).

For example, a two-qubit quantum gate can be modeled by the following two 2-qubit circuit:

A measurement of a qubit takes one of two possible outcomes, either  or. It can be represented by the operator  for the measurement of qubit. The operator represents a measurement of the qubit. A measurement for a quantum system with an operator of the form, where  is a complex number, represents a complex number which represents the measurement result of the quantum system. The operator  represents a measurement of the quantum system. The state of a qubit can be expressed using the above operators as follows:

Quantum Gates

Quantum gates can be used to perform a gate operation such as a Hadamard gate or to control a quantum system. Gates (also known as quantum gates) are a particular class of quantum circuit and function that can be used to change a quantum state. There are many different types of gates and each is represented by their name. There are five types of gates:
 Single-qubit gates The gates are represented by operators () that are defined on a quantum circuit composed of the qubits or quantum circuits as shown in the right top circle above. A single qubit gate is represented by the left-pointing arrow of a single
-qubit operator () that is a complex binary notation.
 Multi-qubit gates The gates are represented by operators () that are defined on a qubit or quantum circuit as shown in the center top circle above. Using four qubits it is possible to control the position of the qubit. This is called a control-target qubit. It can be transformed from the gate state to an eigenstate or an eigenoperator by applying to it a matrix of single-qubit gates. This is called a control-target-rotation matrix or.
 Non-Abelian gates The gates are represented by operators () that are defined on a quantum circuit composed of the qubits or quantum circuits as shown above. Each can be represented by a matrix that contains matrices of control-target-rotation gates. This is called a non-Abelian-gate-matrix, or.
 Multi-controlled-NOT A quantum gate that controls a single and another qubit is called a quantum controlled not gate ( ), which is an Abelian. A matrix representation is needed for performing a controlled-NOT gate that includes an element of the matrix to implement the gate, where this element is either a  ( ) or an arbitrary complex number.
 Quasi-controlled-NOT A quantum gate with the structure of a controlled-NOT gate that is an Abelian is called  ( ). A matrix representation is needed for performing a controlled-NOT gate that contains elements of the matrix as an additional term. This is called a controlled-NOT gate that includes an element of the matrix with the additional term.
 Controlled-NOT gates A single control qubit is used for a quantum circuit. A qubit that is used only once is a logical qubit. The logical qubit is represented as a matrix  ( ) that contains the controls, or single qubit gates,  and  represents the logical qubit and it is the control of the gate. So after the gate is applied to the second qubit the control qubit is always the logical qubit and then the second qubit has a different logical qubit that is determined by its measurement and the measurement of the l
ogical qubit changes the logical state of the second qubit.
 Non-Abelian controlled-NOT gates A single control qubit is not necessary for the gate, the second qubit is not needed. The  operator that is the control of the gate can be represented by. The qubit  which is not the logical qubit is called a control-target-rotation matrix or. It is a matrices representation of a controlled-NOT gate. It is also called a control-target-rotation-matrix.

Quantum computation and quantum computing

A quantum computer uses quantum information, which can be represented by either a complex number or a quantum state. The most popular type of quantum computing is based on quantum measurements. The use of such quantum information is based on quantum mechanics where the quantum states exhibit random fluctuations and where there is a non-vanishing probability of any outcome other than the classical ones. Because of the randomness the outcomes of measurements cannot be predetermined so that the computations that are performed can be performed using the outcomes that are obtained. Quantum mechanics provides a physical framework for computation.

There are certain advantages to this type of computation where the quantum states are used as the computational state vector. These include a greater capacity of the quantum computers and better processing of information that quantum information. They are useful because they are more reliable and more efficient. For example, the amount of information needed for classical computers is much smaller than the amounts used on quantum computers, so computers are faster for the same computation. The speed of quantum computers is much faster than that of classical computers, so computation is faster and hence they are more effective.

Quantum computers can also perform certain tasks using quantum states that are not only the real states of the quantum state but also the quantum states with any state-dependent components. For example, quantum supercompute
rs use quantum states that have the components such as amplitudes, polar form coefficients, and coefficients of some superpositions between different states.

Quantum computers and quantum computing

Quantum computers use the principle of information processing in a general linear way. In general, the basic task of computation would be solved by the following linear transformation.

It is a computation where each digit is replaced with its product of a set of three numbers.

For example it is a multiplication for the number 1x3x3 (or a set of 3 numbers of 1,1, and 1) that is represented by the left lower 3 numbers in the multiplication line.

It is a quantum register that is a collection of qubits consisting of a set of three or four qubits which operate as a quantum register and two ancilla qubits which carry no state information.

The unit quantum state can be defined as follows.

The basis state 
The two-qubit vector  has the dimension of two qubits (qubit-vector) and is a normalized set of qubits as the eigenvalue and eigenvector of the vector operation. That is,. The basis can be represented by a

such as a single qubit state and the basis is described as [1⊗0⊗−1] for its three component vectors, where each component of the vector is the state of one qubit. CNOT represents the sequence of two CNOT operations that transform the single qubit state (and also the second qubit) to a product state of (2) two qubit states. The CNOT gates are not deterministic because of the probabilistic nature of the application. Each transformation of the qubits by the gates is represented in a different basis.

When working with quantum state, we say that the states are state-qubits. A state-qubit or a qubit, in a quantum computer, represents the physical state of a quantum state of a computer. When we perform a measurement we represent the measurement that corresponds to the transformation we have to do to transform the state-qubit into a measurement result state. The transformation that we need to do to the state-qubit is represented by two vectors. When working with state-qubits, we will use the notation  as a state for a qubit. The representation of a computational quantum state is given by a matrix that contains a one-dimensional vector for each qubit. The states in a quantum computer can be measured using quantum interference like devices to manipulate the quantum states or they can also be prepared using quantum control methods as described in figure 2. These devices are called Quantum Computers.

Quantum entanglement of the computational state occurs when we apply operations onto the computational quantum state that modify the state of two or more qubits when they are not part of the same measurement and therefore will allow a physical measurement to be performed.

Quantum computation is a computational paradigm in science which is able to solve problems not possible in classical systems and to work in an effectively infinite space. A
computational problem is an instance of a mathematical problem where one or more physical laws should be solved. The computational quantum mechanical problem is like a problem that is a problem within quantum mechanics itself or quantum mechanics could be solved using classical computation. The computational problems are called quantum computational problems.

Quantum computing models that can help us solve quantum computational problems are called quantum algorithms. Quantum algorithms are mathematical models of quantum information processing in quantum computer. Quantum algorithms are an alternative to classical algorithms, because they do not use classical computation, which is an approximation of a computation which takes more resource. The quantum algorithms consist of three stages: preparation, encoding and measurement. The preparation stage includes building the quantum system, preparing the quantum computer. The encoding stage is the building of the input to the computer. The measurement stage is the manipulation of the quantum computer quantum information. In this stage we manipulate the quantum information in our quantum system.

A quantum computer that can solve a quantum computational problem using one of the following five operations is called a Quantum Computator. Figure 3 shows these five operations together.

The quantum logic circuit:

It consists of 20 qubits as shown in figure 3. The qubit system (as shown in figures 3 and 4) is shown in the picture, from left to right to top. We also use the representation of the qubits as is shown in figure 5. The computational basis (represented as square boxes in figures 3 and 5) corresponds to a physical qubit. The quantum states are represented by the vectors. These vectors are not in the vector space (representing a physical qubit) and are represented as their component vectors are. A qubit can be represented by a set of one-dimensional vectors, represented in a matrix that is the representation of a quant
um state, that represent a set of classical logical states which are equivalent to each other. A logical qubit can be written as [1⊗0⊗0] in which 1 represent the state of one bit of a logical one, 0 represent the state of two bits, and 0 represent the state of all the three. This is the qubit representation of a logical input, one or two-bit logical state, one-bit logical state, three-bit (or all three)-bit state. The logical output is determined by combining the states into pairs that represent which bit is the same as the logical input. Therefore a pair of states are equivalent to a particular logical input if and only if the input bit is the same.

The quantum operations:

The quantum gates that can be used to implement a quantum computational model are called quantum gates in quantum information theory. Quantum gates that represent quantum gates are called quantum operations in QIP theory. They are also called quantum gates. A quantum gate consists of classical computational basis applied to a quantum computational basis. A quantum gate acts as an operator that changes the computational basis of the quantum computational basis to a different computational basis. The gates are also useful in classifying the logical functions that can be performed by quantum gate, and in the application of quantum gates. There are specific gates that can be used for controlling qubits. The CNOT gates which will be discussed later are the most common that are widely used to control qubits. The CNOT gates, the gates that are represented by CNOT gates in figure 4 are also called a quantum computation that will be discussed in depth in chapter 5. However, it is important to note that these gates can be used to convert the two single qubit basis to any single qubit basis by two sequential CNOT operations. We will discuss below two types of CNOT gates which are also called CNOT gate and CNOT gate, which is a CNOT gate that is shown in picture 5. The CNOT gates in figure 4 are shown belo
w in figure 4a and 4b.

A quantum gate can be constructed from two quantum gates together, and called a quantum circuit that is represented by a set of four vectors (see figure 5). It is composed from four CNOT gates, where each CNOT gate is represented by a box in the figure and CNOT stands for the CNOT gate.

The CNOT gate that is presented to us in figure 4a and 4b. Figure 5 shows the different CNOT gates that can be created by the CNOT gates shown in the picture.

A quantum gate needs two qubits to perform the gate. Since CNOT gates act as logical gates it only makes sense to treat two qubits as a computational basis as an example that represent a quantum computational state as a binary-valued 1 or 0 that can represent a logical input or logical output.

A quantum operation can be said to consist of a mathematical formalism that describes the physical implementation of the behavior of the quantum hardware. In quantum information theory the meaning of such an operation is important because it indicates what we can represent the physical quantum hardware in a language that we use to describe the quantum computation in a quantum computational model. The meaning of the concept will be given after a
probabilistic operation of one qubit from the basis set of C2 to L is represented by R−2 = R−1+1−1R−1(L12) = L−1+1−1R⊗+1 = L−1⊗L12 = I⊗−1L−1. Then a probabilistic operation from the basis set of R−1⊗L12 to L is represented by L−1+1−1R⊗+1 = L−2+1−1R⊗+(L−2)I=−1L⊗L−2.

When a probabilistic operation on a single qubit accepts probabilistic outcomes, the probabilistic operation must be represented by a real number. In the probabilistic operation shown in the figure, the probabilistic matrix L-1 as well as I and R are treated as variables, their probabiliy probabilities are obtained as the determinant, and the outcomes are represented by the value of the determinant. When the probabilistic operation from the basis set of C2 to L12 is represented by R−2⊗L12, one finds the following determinant: R−2=−1L12 = −1(−1) = 1−1. Therefore the two probabilistic operations on each qubit can be represented by the determinant P, and the determinants of the CNOT gate matrix L12 and the matrix B from the two original qubits R6 and L12 are: |R|^2 = 1−1 = 1⊗1, |L|^2 = 1⊗−1 = −1⊗1. By computing the determinants of these matrices we can extract the transformation between the probabilistic qubit basis sets of C2 and L12 (the probabilistic qubit basis sets are represented by the determinant Q): |C2|^2 = P⊗L+1⊗L−1 = −(−1⊕1)⊗L−1 = |L12|^2. Then if Q=0, the determinant is 0 and if Q is either ±1, then Q+ 1 and Q−1 will have the same determinant.

We can combine the two CNOT gates to form a single CNOT gate given by R6 ⊗ L6 = R⊗L12⊗L12 = I⊗L12⊗I = −I⊗C2 if these operations work in the same direction. Similarly, the two probabilistic operations can be combined to form a probabilistic CNOT gate given by C−1 ⊗ L−1 = (C2 − 1) ⊗ L−1 from C2 to L12. In this case, we have the matrix A which is given by R1 ⊗ L2 = (R2⊗L2) −1 = −(C2−1⊗L2)⊗L2 and a CNOT gate C2 from the CNOT gate basis L11 to L, because L1⊗L11 = −(C2−1⊗I)⊗L2. The matrix A is the same for the CNOT gate basis L12 to L12 and the matrix A3 is th
e same for the C−1 ⊗ L−1 = C−1⊗L12 to L12.

So let us find out the transformation between probabilistic qubit basis C2 and the CNOT gate basis of both L11 and L12, that is, the corresponding transforming operation R6⊗L6 and L12⊗L12. The transformation can be calculated in the following form: R6 ⊗ L6 = −I⊗L6=−I⊗L−1⊗L−1 and therefore R6⊗L6 = −(I−1⊗I−1)⊗L−1 = I −1⊗(I−1)L−1 = −(I−1⊗I−1)⊗C2 = −I⊗C2⊗C2−1. Then by using R6 ⊗ C2,L6 = I−1⊗C2+1⊗C−1⊗L6 = C1⊗C2−1⊗L6 and by using L12⊗L6 = −(I−1⊗I−1)⊗L−1⊗L−1 = I−1⊗L−1⊗C1⊗C2−1⊗L−1⊗L−1⊗C2−1⊗L−1⊗L−1⊗C1⊗C2−1⊗L−1⊗L−1⊗L−1 we can get L12⊗L6 = −I⊗C1⊕C2−1⊕B−1⊕C2+1⊕C2⊕C2−1⊕B−1⊕C2⊕C2⊕C2−1⊕B−1⊕L−1⊗L−1⊗L−1⊗C1⊕L−1⊗L−1⊗C2⊕C2−1⊕B−1⊕C1⊕L−1⊗C2⊕C2−1⊕C1⊕C1⊗L−1⊗C1�
information, and quantum computations are how humans are able to compute using quantum systems. With quantum systems also being able to change energies, it has become relatively easier to apply quantum reasoning to various computing architectures. The second type of circuit is a quantum gate, which is not to the quantum gate but rather a quantum algorithm. Quantum computing and quantum gate algorithms can be used for both classical and quantum computation. The third type of circuit is the classical, classical circuit. It is a circuit where the information is sent into a classical processor (CPU) and the processor then sends the information to the classical storage. This is a classical computation. If the information is also sent through a quantum gate algorithm, and one or several of the computational qubits make a transition to lower energy states, then it becomes a quantum gate. There are other types of quantum circuits with functions not directly quantum computation, but these are beyond the scope of our discussion. It is not our intention to complicate the discussion by discussing qubits and quantum gates. We have explored this topic thoroughly in an earlier, more general publication called Quantum Circuits and Gates (which will appear as part of the proceedings of our Symposium in Computational Intelligence). We believe that this discussion can also lead to new insights and discoveries that are of greater help to researchers and students of quantum computing. Our presentation of the theory, mathematics, and applications for these concepts will be made as an accompanying paper in the proceedings of the symposium. Quantum Computers Can Handle More Than 2 Bits Of Information

We consider a quantum computer with two classical bits. Given any pair of classical bits x,y that are both in state “00”, our quantum computer is given with one qubit that will take x to be an “1” and another qubit that will take y to be an “0.” It is an open question how the two classical b
its are to be combined and what will happen if there is a loss or gain in information between them.

At first the loss of information between the two bits in the quantum circuit will cause the output bit y to be 0, as it is simply an “idle” or “empty” classical bit. In this example the information is lost without being sent. This type of quantum computer is called a quantum error-correcting memory (QECM) or a quantum error-correcting code (QECC). We will call this a “classical” (or “binary-information”) memory because the information that is needed is also stored within the system. We could think of this “1” as the one bit information, so on the classical side y represents 0. If y were 0, the information within the system is 0, and the information would be lost. We can imagine two possible cases where the information is not lost, and here we are going to discuss two of those cases. Case 1: x is 0, but y is 1 This will be a type of quantum error-correcting circuit (QECC) where there is no information lost. In that case the classical bit is a 1 bit and the quantum bit is a 0 bit.

Case 2: x is 1 and y is 0 This will be an error-correcting device whose classical bits are 0 but whose quantum bits are 1. The reason that we call it a QECC/QECM is because no information is lost through the correction mechanism (although the computer will always have a bit of information on the classical side). This case also shows the types of correction and information that we can store and protect. This type of circuit will allow us both to have 0 qubits in classical bit “0” and 1 qubits in classical bit “1.”

In both cases we see that the quantum information that we need when the initial classical information is being transferred is also being transferred in the quantum circuit. In these examples we see that “0” is the quantum bit that we need to use as the classical information is being copied into it. We can also see in both examples that, when it is considered that some portion of th
e quantum information is lost, there is still information from that portion of the classical information being copied into the quantum information. We then see, in both of these two examples, the “classical bit 0” will have the most information and “classical bit 1” has the least information, so if y were to become 1, this would be the information that we would be receiving from the quantum circuit. When the information is lost in the quantum circuit, we will have 0 quantum bits in the classical information and the 2 classical bits that we had for the circuit could no longer be copied to have as much information on the classical side as there was information in the quantum circuit.

So we see that the loss of information in quantum circuit can affect both the classical and quantum systems. When something is lost in quantum circuits, we have lost information in our quantum computers that we can use a classical computer and we have lost something in the classical computer that will allow it to be used. In this case, an important fact is that we still need information from the classical computer if it is being copied into the quantum system. We would like to be able to access that information and do what we need to do without having to access it. The type of information that we use in our classical computation or information in our classical memories is what allows us to use the classical computer by accessing and comparing it to the quantum system's classical information. Now let's consider the problem of quantum gates and how are these problems related to solving a problem.

We will take a basic example that is the classical AND of the input bits 0,1 and the classical function is equal to 1 when its inputs are all 0. So we get one of the classical bits that will be sent to the classical computing bit. Similarly, with the AND of the classical function and 0 for the input 0,1, if 0 is the input 0, we get 0 as the classical bit that may be used for classical processing.
The reason it is true for the classical AND of the classical 0,0 input bits is because 0 and 1 are the classical bits of information that need to be sent to the quantum computer to complete its computation. We can see here another issue with the classical AND of the classical gates, when we consider that 0 and 1 will be the classical bits that the computer will use; the information in this case is being sent to the computing qubits to complete a quantum gate. The quantum gates in our quantum computation of the AND of 0,0 and 1 allow us to send classical information to the quantum bits. In quantum computing we often take the classical information and then apply quantum gates to the classical information and the classical information that is sent to quantum computation will be changed to a quantum state. Quantum error correction can be applied after the computation to prevent this type of quantum error correction. Here we use an example of quantum error correction to show the different quantum gates that are possible.

Quantum gates are not all there are when it comes to quantum gates, but they are still useful for a quantum computing system as the operation of a quantum gate can be used in a number of different ways. Let's take an example of the classical information used in quantum gate applications. We use our
for the qubit. A two-qubit Hadamard gate is made up of 2 quantum circuits where  is as a logical bit and each element of Q is a measurement that the two qubits produce. The quantum circuit that stores quantum information is represented by  and the logic operation is. If the quantum circuit was to store the initial state instead of the logic operation then the Hadamard gate would be represented by, a single operation. If the Hadamard gate were to make both the measurement and the logical bit measurement, then the Hadamard gate would be written as. A Hadamard gate can be transformed into another circuit by the gate rotation circuit R in. The Q circuit can be represented by  for  and  for the gate rotation as shown in the circuit in Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"}. Fig. 1Two-qubit logical gate. The Hadamard gate operation that takes two quantum bits and makes a bit-flip operation is represented by the two qubit gate rotation circuit R, from [[@CR1]] Fig. 2Single qubit to gate transformation in the quantum circuit. A single qubit can be turned in two different states by a controlled-NOT gate and a gate operation on two logical qubits that is a Hadamard gate in this example. As a result, a single qubit can be transformed into two different logic operations

The transformation in the circuit that makes the Hadamard gate can be represented using the gate operation  as shown in Fig. [2](#Fig2){ref-type="fig"} that it is a logical 1 bit and a logical 0 bit respectively in the circuit. Here,,,  and represent the logical bit 0 for the logical 1, and logical 0, which can also be represented by. The Hadamard gate makes a logical 1 bit measurement on the qubit at  and leaves the qubit at. If the logical 1 bit measurement were made at the qubit, then one could calculate the logical 1 bit by using the gate operation on the two qubits that change the logical 1 bit as shown in Fig. [3](#Fig3){ref-type="fig"} that it is a logical 0 logical 1 bit measurement. The first circuit in Fi
g. [4](#Fig4){ref-type="fig"} is a single qubit operation that transforms to a logical 1 bit and a logical 0 bit. The second circuit in Fig. [5](#Fig5){ref-type="fig"} is a single qubit operation that transforms to a logical 0 bit and a logical 1 bit measurement on the left qubit. As a result, the transformation does not produce the full quantum operation but instead only the logical 0 bit and the logical 1 bit. Using the single qubit gates in the circuit in Fig. [4](#Fig4){ref-type="fig"} or the single qubit gate operation in Fig. [5](#Fig5){ref-type="fig"}, the Hadamard gate in Fig. [3](#Fig3){ref-type="fig"} can be made, for example, to produce the logical 0 bit by using the second circuit in Fig. [5](#Fig5){ref-type="fig"} or the logical 1 bit by using the circuit in Fig. [4](#Fig4){ref-type="fig"}. Fig. 3Single qubit gate operation result. A single qubit can be expressed by two logical states when transformed into a Hadamard gate and the gate operation on two logical qubits. The measurement of the logical bit makes a one bit flip operation. A single qubit is a bit. It requires a measurement measurement on the input qubit and one of its outputs and a logical measurement on the two inputs at the two gates Fig. 4Two qubit gate operation result. The Hadamard gate operation that takes two qubit bits and makes a logical bit flip operation is represented by the two qubit gates R,, from [[@CR4]]; the single qubit operation becomes two qubit gates R,, which transform a single qubit into two qubit gates and make the Hadamard gate. A single qubit measurement operation produces the left gate for the Hadamard gate as in Fig. [3](#Fig3){ref-type="fig"}. The single qubit gate operation produces the right gate for the Hadamard gate as in Fig. [5](#Fig5){ref-type="fig"}, where the gates are represented by,, and The second qubit gates are for the measurement at the left qubit and the gates are as in Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type="fig"} Fig. 5Hadamard gate operation produced by the
single qubit gate operation. The Hadamard gate operation that takes two qubit bits and makes a logical bit flip operation is represented by the two qubit gates R and, as shown in Fig. [2](#Fig2){ref-type="fig"}. A single qubit is a bit. It requires a measurement measurement on the input qubit and one of its outputs and a logic measurement on the two inputs at the two gates

In addition, a controlled-NOT gate can be written as a one-qubit controlled-NOT gate operation  where  denotes the control operator while  denotes the target logic operation. The one-qubit controlled-NOT gate operation transforms a control bit to a control logic bit by a single application of the gate operation on two qubits. For example, the gates  and  transform the qubit to the logic 1 bit if one of the two logical operators in  is the logical 0 bit and vice versa, and the gates  and  transform the qubit to the logic 0 bit if one of the two logical operators in  is the logical 1 bit and the other logical 1 bit. If one of the two logical operators in  is the logical 1 bit then the gates  and  transform the qubit into the logic 1 bit operation. In the case of two-qubit controlled-NOT gates, it can be represented as either one-qubit-controlled-NOT gates  and or two-qubit-controlled-NOT gates. Here  represents the left and  and  represent the right qubits for the logical control and the logical target operation, respectively as shown in Fig. [6](#Fig6){ref-type="fig"}. The two qubits operate as one logical 1 and a logical 0. The input bit (the logical unit Q), two controlled inputs (Q) into the gate, the target (the logic operation Q*) and the control (the output Q) are represented by,,, and, respectively. The first circuit in Fig. [6](#Fig6){ref-type="fig"} that is two-qubit controlled-NOT gate is made by the gate operation  as shown in Fig. [7](#Fig7){ref-type="fig"} where  denotes the logical 1 and  the logic 0 bits. The second circuit in Fig. [7](#Fig7){ref-type="fig"} is
as follows: The CNOT gate acts on two qubits in the same basis, to transform the qubit state into: [0⊗0⊗1⊗−1] (x,y) +  [−1⊗0⊗1⊗1] (x,y) −  [1⊗0⊗1⊗0] (x,y). 

The other operation in a circuit is called a measurement. A qubit measurement represents a probability or a value of the measurement. The measurement can be probabilistic or when it is described by a probability distribution. Probabilistic measurements can be described by a probability distribution. Two different measurements can affect the same qubit, a special measure tes can be done with more than two measurements. Measurements can be described by the Pauli matrices M1, M2, M3, M4 and their complex conjugates C1, C2, C3, C4. All the operations can be defined and realized with them. A probabilistic operation consists in a series of operations using different quantum devices such as a quantum gate or a set of qubits in the circuit. A particular quantum gate or a quantum gate set uses a particular basis or representation of a qubit that is called the CNOT gate and can be represented as [0⊗0⊗1⊗−1] as it is shown in figure 1. An example of a CNOT gate is given above. The other operation in a circuit is called a measurements. A probability distribution includes the outcome of the measurement, that is, a value of the measurement. Probabilistic measurements can be described by a probability distribution. Two different measurements can affect the same qubit, a special measure can be done with more than two measurements. Measurements can be described by the Pauli matrices M1, M2, M3, M4 and their complex conjugates C1, C2, C3, C4. All the operations can be defined and realized with them. Quantum computation works in the quantum world in different ways than classical computation. In quantum computation you can have "quantum" gates (which we will talk about soon) in which the qubits act by measuring (the CNOT gate) to obtain "classical" states according to the classical model of computation or they can work as probabil
istic gates (the gate is defined as the multiplication of a product of probabilistic gates but which don't affect the system in a way that doesn't effect the probabilistic value of the product). Classical computation is performed with a classical machine that accepts, does not forget, accepts probabilistic values and does the task. Quantum computation works in a different way. You can have different states in quantum variables, such as a phase, to control the state of the quantum computation, they can be quantum operations that do the operations, such as the CNOT gate, they can be probabilistic operations that can accept probabilistic outputs. There are several families of computational power (see figure 2) that can be classified as quantum computing: quantum algorithms, quantum parallelism and quantum cryptography.

(a) Quantum algorithms are a class of quantum computation that can use quantum states in a way that cannot be used for conventional classical computation algorithms. Quantum algorithm is a type of quantum computation that uses quantum information and has many applications in computer science. Example of quantum algorithms are Shor' algorithm, Polynomial time algorithm and QED. (b) Quantum parallelism is a type of quantum computation based on the same kind of quantum states that can be used in both classical and quantum algorithms. Example of quantum parallelism is Shor' polynomial time and Kitaev model of quantum random access memory. Quantum cryptography is a quantum information technology based on the use of quantum states to provide confidentiality and data security. (c) Quantum cryptography is a type of encryption algorithm based on the same kind of quantum states that can be used in both classical and quantum algorithms. Example of quantum cryptography is the Merkle's scheme, Schnorr's scheme, Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm, El Gamal code, etc. For each implementation of particular quantum algorithm, the quantum state can be represented by a
set of quantum variables (which also include the measurement outcome) or by a quantum state vector. The algorithm operates on the quantum states and has a number of variables called input qubits and one output qubit (for the result of the operation). The input can be prepared in different kinds of states and the result can be measured in a specific kind of basis. Example of quantum cryptography is one way that uses the same kind of quantum states that can be used in classical and quantum algorithms. In particular the use of qubits which is the same as the quantum variables, can be one of the reasons for being able to perform quantum algorithms with a set of quantum variables. (d) Quantum computation in the circuit model means that it uses quantum gates in the circuit. Example of quantum computation in the circuit model is Shor' algorithm. (e) Quantum parallelism means that the computation can be performed by taking advantage of the quantum properties that do not depend on the input. Example of quantum parallelism is Shor' polynomial time which uses the same kind of quantum computation that implements Shor' algorithm. quantum cryptography is an encryption scheme based on the use of quantum states to provide confidentiality and data security. (f) Quantum cryptography was invented and developed about three decades ago. Examples of quantum cryptography are RSA, El Gamal code, Shamir secret sharing scheme and ElGamal code encryption. Quantum parallelism in the circuit model means that the computation can be performed by taking advantage of quantum properties that does not depend on the input. Quantum encryption is an encryption scheme based on the use of quantum information instead of classical information. Examples of quantum encryption are the RSA encryption scheme, the El Gamal encryption scheme, the Schneier-Milner cipher and the ElGamal encryption scheme. Quantum parallelism in the circuit model means that it uses quantum gates in the circuit. Example of quantum pa
rallelism is Shor' polynomial time. Quantum cryptography is a technology that uses quantum states to provide security, encryption or decryption according to the different algorithms. (g) Quantum computing works using quantum states in the quantum world. Examples of quantum computation are one way that uses the very own quantum states that can be used in both classical and quantum algorithms. As in the previous item (a) quantum algorithms uses quantum state in a way that cannot be used for existing classical computing algorithm. Quantum algorithm is a type of quantum computation that uses quantum information and has many applications of computer science. Quantum algorithm is a type of quantum computation that can use quantum states that cannot be used for conventional classical computation algorithm. Quantum algorithm uses quantum states that is prepared using quantum information and has a number of variables called input qubits and one output qubit (for the result of the algorithm). The input can be prepared in different kinds of states and the result can be measured in a specific kind of basis. Example of quantum algorithm
ions A2 ⊗ B3 and B3 ⊗ will also be probabilistic with probability 0/1, where A3 ⊗ B3 = –L is the CNOT gate basis, and C2 ⊗ B3 = L12 is the CNOT gate basis. This means that if the measurement on qubit 3 changes, then the outcome of the operation A3 ⊗ B1 is also probabilistic. Therefore the A3 ⊗ B1 and B2 ⊗ −B, two probabilistic outputs to change in state, will also change with the same probabilities. The output state of the A3 ⊗ B1 is –R12 where R12= A3 ⊗ B3 is the gate C2 = R−1⊗L12) and B1 ⊗ −B is the gate L12 where L12 = I−2⊗R12 is the gate C2. And the state of the qubit B2 ⊗ −B is the state of qubit 2 which will change to the state L12(See Probabilistic Qubit). By changing qubit 3, for example, the operation A2 ⊗ B3 is probabilistic with probability 0/1 and B3 ⊗ −L is probabilistic with probability 0/1 also where L12 = I−2⊗R12 is the gate C2. Therefore, the action on the second qubit will change with equal probabilities as that of the first qubit and vice-versa. Because of the probabilistic action on a qubit, a qubit can be in a superposition state. For example, if A2 ⊗ B3 is probabilistic, then A2 ⊗ B1 ⊗ −B1 ⊗ ∑∘R6 = A3 ⊗ B3 ⊗⊗C6 = A2 ⊗ B3 ⊗⊗R6. Or if A2 ⊗ B1 is probabilistic B1 ⊗ −B is probabilistic and the qubit B2 is in superposition, then B2 ⊗ B3 ⊗ ∑∘L12 = B1 ⊗ −B. This means that B2 ⊗ −B ⊗ C6 C2 = R12 ⊗L12 = +I⊗−1L12, where R12 = A3 ⊗ B3 ⊗, a different gate from A3 and B3, and L12 = I−2⊗R12 is the gate C2. Therefore as illustrated in figure 2 and table I, the operation on qubits 2 and 3 (A2 ⊗ B3 are probabilistic) and qubits 1 and 3 (B3) (B1 ⊗ −B are probabilistic) are represented by the following three quantum gates C2, C2 and C2 respectively. Table: Qubit quantum gates C2 From A to B, for example, the operation on qubit 2 the C2 gate is R−2⊗L12 = I−2+1−1I⊗+1 = −R12 and the operation on the qubit 3 the C2 gate is L12 = I−2⊗R12 = A3 ⊗ B3 ⊗ −L12, where L12 = I−2⊗R12 is the gate C2. In the equation, the operation on the qubits 2 and 3 also C2 and L12 is in sup
erposition with probability 0/1. By changing a particular qubit state or a measurement output, we can change the outcome of the C gate operation at the C gate basis of these qubits. Therefore the transformation between C2 gate basis L12 and C2 gate C gate basis C2 is R−2⊗L12 = I−2+1−1I⊗+1 = −R12. Figure: C gate basis for all the gats In this example of a quantum circuit, the circuits on the bottom of the figure and the above circuit are the same, so the figure is a generalization of this example. In particular, the operations used in all these circuits are described in this form. For the gat e, A, is a qubit, C2, is a set of gate C gates which are defined as C2 = R−2⊗L12 = I−2+1−1I⊗+1 = −R12 and C2 ⊗ = L12 is similarly defined as C2 ⊗ = R12⊗L12 = +I⊗−1L12. The operations A, B, C and D, shown in top of the figure, are probabilistic with probability of 0/1. This means that if the outcome of the operation B is changed then the output C2 ⊗ may also change to the state C, meaning that the operation C2 changes with the same probability as all the other gate Cs. The operation on the gate B will change with probability 0/1 due to being probabilistic. The outcome of the operation A will also change with the same probability as that of B, and the other operations do not change with the same probability as that of A. Therefore the transformation between C gate basis L12 and C2 gate basis C2 is R−2⊗L12 = I−2+1−1I⊗+1 = −R12. Figure: C gate basis in all gats A = A3 ⊗ B3 = –∑∘A3 ⊗B3 −∑∘A3 ⊗B1 and B = B3 ⊗ A3 = –∑∘B3 ⊗A3 for the quantum circuit A and B are probabilistic, and C 2 �
change to logical states. A quantum gate changes logic and works as both a function and state changeer. We will discuss both the function and the state changeer a little more closely in the next chapter. A classical gate will be shown to change logic into a classical state, by either flipping one of the many (logical) bits or moving the state to another state. A quantum gate, on the other hand, changes a single qubit (two classical bits) into a lower energy state by placing another qubit (a classical bit) in high energy state to allow that state to persist. The classical gate acts as an AND gate, moving the logical bit from one state to the other, and will move the state from state1 to state 0. The NOT gate will not act as an AND gate, changing the logical bit to the complementary state of the gate (that is, state1 to state0). The AND gate acts as an XOR gate, where both logical states are the state of one qubit. The NOT gate is shown to change the logic state of a qubit that is XORs with the complement of the AND gate. There are many other types of quantum gates including multiplexors, phase gates, etc. We will discuss two of these functions and their roles later in the book. The most common type of quantum devices that are used in quantum computers is the probabilistic quantum computation (PPQ) (see quantum algorithms, chapter 3), which is a type of quantum circuit whose gates are probabilistic and whose outputs are probabilistic. Each PQC has one or more probabilistic output functions, which are calculated using the Quantum Probabilistic Function(QPF) algorithm or any other algorithm that computes probabilistic functions. In Chapter 2 we will discuss how to construct a PQC as a classical circuit. There are many other types of probabilistic functions that exist: The Probabilistic Number Function (PDF) and the Probabilistic Logical Functions (PLF) are two of the most common functions, because PDFs can be used to define probabilistic arithmetic, and PLFs can be use
d to define probabilistic logical systems as well as probabilistic circuits. The probabilistic computing resources from quantum gate operations and quantum sensors are extremely powerful, providing extremely powerful functions for performing the same operations in probabilistic manner, allowing quantum computers to exhibit very high complexity (see quantum sensing, chapter 5). So far, though, it's been shown how classical computers (a kind which are not yet quantum computers) could implement probabilistic arithmetic and computation, but how might such powerful probabilistic functions be implemented in quantum computers on a typical device (like a classical computer). The PQC functions are also very simple in construction. It's possible to model a probabilistic function in a classical circuit that generates a probabilistic output. A typical circuit might look like this: This circuit generates a probability wave function which is then used to calculate the output function from which the Probabilistic Function can be derived. For example: The probabilistic function (PDF) is a probability wave function that is used to create a classical result. It is a probability function which is created by multiplying some classical function (or operation) by some classical variable, producing a probability value. Many probabilistic functions do the same thing, like PDF = [PDF, PDF]. This PDF will multiply the function by a classical variable, like PDF = [PDF, PDF], to get a probability outcome. One way to do something like this is to define an operation on the classical variable, by combining the classical function and the two bits (state) to create a Boolean result. A classical variable can also be used to model the quantum logic gate, which is the combination of both states of the device. We show how this works next. The Probabilistic Number Function is a probabilistic function that takes two classical integers as inputs and produces a probabilistic integers as an output. Suppose
the first integer is a bit number that represents a binary number of length n. In a classical computer to represent this number, the bits have a single value and correspond to 1 through n possible values. The Probabilistic Number Function has a function that can take that number of n possible values which corresponds to two numbers (binary integers) as inputs. The result is a probability value, which can be interpreted as a probability of success or probability of failure, as described by the PDF functions. When applied to a classical variable, the value that will produce the output is an integer such as PDF = [PDF, PDF]. So far, it is clear that the output can be created using two bits. The two bits can correspond to: The Probabilistic Logic Functions (PLFs), and In the case of PDF = [PDF, PDF] this means that the function is a probabilistic function that is applied to the second bit, rather than the first. The PLF is a probabilistic function, which takes two outputs as inputs and produces a probabilistic output. When you apply a probabilistic function to an input, it produces one thing (the output) that you want, and it produces the thing that you want it to produce (an output). For example, XORs (exclusive or) is a function that applies a probabilistic value to two inputs, producing an output that is either equal to one of the inputs or not equal to one of the inputs. In addition to XOR gates, probabilistic functions may be applied to functions that are not probabilistic such as ANDs (AND gates) and XORs that do not return a probabilistic result (OR functions). Using the PDF function, it's possible to construct a XOR gate and produce a probabilistic result for its output. A Probabilistic Gate The Probabilistic Gates are the most efficient and universal probabilistic operations, and are the gates in the quantum circuit that actually accomplish probabilistic operation because of their high efficiency. Probabilistic Gates are the basis of probabilistic computation.
A quantum gate that operates on an quantum qubit of the circuit converts a qubit into a qubit that has higher energy to maintain that state for a longer period of time at a constant rate. This method is used in quantum computers to perform their task. The quantum gate functions can be used more than once like one-time state switches or one-time quantum gates that allow quantum devices to change logic. There are many different types of quantum gates. In most quantum computing paradigms, quantum gates are used to perform probabilistic logic gates. For example, there are the conditional and unconditional quantum logic gates, which operate on conditional and unconditional states, respectively (this section discusses both of these types). In quantum computing, a quantum gate is basically a quantum operation (a function that acts on a quantum state) which is reversible (can be reversed, so to speak). One way to think of a quantum gate as a logical function or operation, is to say that to create a quantum gate, or perform a quantum logical function, is like creating a logical function, which can be reversed, or inverted, and then act upon that logic function. So, a conditional gate is a logical function, which acts on a lower energy state, such as a higher energy state (to maintain that state for a longer period of time
of the three qubits used to perform the operation. The state 

The quantum state of a system is represented by a wave function that is defined by a density matrix,  where  is called the wave function amplitude (i.e. a probability) and  is the Hilbert space operator (i.e. an operator) on the system. Quantum mechanics allows us to represent a wave function as a set of amplitudes (usually called the  qubit) or as a single amplitude, which is an operator-defined function of the density matrix:, where  is a coefficient that depends on the type of measurement used to represent the state of the quantum system

In classical computing these two representations are the usual binary number and the set of non-negative real numbers, respectively, which are called classical probability. The representation  on classical space is a set of discrete binary numbers with a density matrix. However, the density matrix is defined in quantum mechanics and a quantum wave function can be represented by a set of quantum amplitudes, known as  (or simply qubit) that are a set of complex numbers. The quantum wave function is represented by a qubit, 

However, if the mathematical and physical models of quantum mechanics used in computing were to match those in classical mechanics, the wave function can be represented in a very simple form: the probability amplitude of a quantum state. This can be made true not only for the classical computational models, but also for the quantum computing models of quantum mechanical systems in that, like classical computers, a quantum computer performs operations and measurements that are performed by a wave function
. For example, the  that represents  is an operation that creates  probability wave function amplitudes from a quantum wave function 

that represents  where  is called the probability amplitude. These  are just functions that depend on the type of measurement that is used for representing the state of the quantum system,, and  are the amplitude of
the states that the qubit has. It is also a matter of convention to denote the measurement by the  symbol only, but this is only done for mathematical convenience, since the  is not a measure of the "probability" of the state of the system, but of the number of elements in the quantum state. The  is called the density matrix, and it consists of the probability amplitude matrix and the measurement matrix

where  is the Hermitian transpose operator, usually abbreviated to H or HX. The measurement matrix is the projection operator for measuring the qubit. The above definitions are also shown in a more formal way by the following equation:

The eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of the density matrix, i.e. the probabilities of the qubit being in a particular state. Thus, the eigenvalue  that represents the state for the qubit can be calculated by

For example, the quantum state can be written as 
where the  state represents the logical state of a classical bit string (i.e., and the measurement state  represents  for the logical state : ). It can be seen that a classical bit string with a single digit  or 0 has either value "0" or "1" representing one or the other, depending on whether or not the digit is the first digit, i.e.

A qubit of length  is represented by one of the three states {|q 0 〉, |q 1 〉 and |q 2 〉}, and so the density matrix represented by the above equation can also be written as

As expected, every qubit is the sum of the density matrix  and the projection on the "base" state, which can also be written as:

As mentioned earlier, the projection on the actual state  can be obtained by

For example: 

where the  represents the measurement of the qubit. This allows a quantum state to be described as a set of amplitudes on a system whose "probability" is the same as the weight. In computer science this is referred to as the system of probability diagrams. A  is a set of quantum amplitudes on a system that represents the quantum state of the system. For exampl
e, in the case of the quantum states and, where we know that the density matrix is an  such that  and  are probabilities (where the  represents the measurement), if we also assume that the  form a set of amplitudes on a quantum state to represent its state, it is easy to show the quantum state of the system must be 

where  is the eigenvalue of the density matrix. For example, the  such that  represent the eigenvalues of the density matrix will represent a classical state of a classical bit string, for example 

It is also worth noting that  representing the  can be obtained from : 

so all the eigenvalues corresponding to the quantum nature of the qubit are found from 

In general, for a wavefunction which is represented by a set of amplitudes that form a system of probabilities, as can be seen from the above definition,

The above definition and the above equation are equivalent and all of the amplitude information is represented by the probabilities, while the states are represented by the basis vectors in Hilbert space as is evident from the above equation.

Qubit state preparation with quantum gates

Let us look at a qubit state in general, before discussing a particular quantum computation algorithm. For each qubit state, there exist two operations  that can be performed on the qubit to obtain this state :

One of the operations is typically called a NOT (NOT gate) operation, where it is said to "not-do" or "not-do" a bit flip on the qubit by negating both the states. In a classical computer, the NOT gate is implemented as "NOT" and negation on bits via the negation convention of "NOT" or the AND gate. The other operation is a Hadamard gate.

Let us first discuss a single-qubit quantum computation or measurement operation and then consider what quantum gates can be used to implement the two operations.

Single qubit measurements

If a measurement is performed on a quantum system that contains a single qubit, this is a classical system. If we perform a single m
easurement of the probability of the single qubit on an unknown quantum state, this can be written as

In the following, we will use  to denote the corresponding quantum amplitudes of the state, and  to denote the corresponding measurement on the qubit which is described by the density matrices. We consider classical systems whose operators represent classical probabilities:

For example, if the qubit was described as

the system has classical probability amplitudes and the states corresponding to  and  are probabilities. The value of  on the qubit is represented by the classical probability amplitudes 0 and 1. Because of the density matrix, the state corresponding to the classical probability  can be written as

Because of the density matrix, a measurement of the qubit can be performed by using the classical probability amplitude, for example, as

a single measurement of
a bit flip gates with no probability of occurrence.

The two-qubit state that can be encoded is a unit vector for each qubit. The operator to measure a qubit's state is the Pauli operator M, which is defined as a matrix of M, an orthonormal basis for both classical and quantum basis, which is used in the state representation. A valid measurement on the two qubit state represented by the qubit vector and the Pauli operator M is expressed by M. If a qubit state vector M is projected onto the valid measurement result state M = [±1/2]i’ is not a valid measurement result, where i is the orthogonal basis in which the measurement result state is defined between ±1/2. Therefore, a measurement is probabilistic, in the sense that the measurement is not performed as the only action on the measured qubit, but instead may involve its influence on the state of the other qubit.  A set of measurements on the qubits that are called a set of operators is a matrix of operators for each qubit, that represents a set of measurement operators. A set of measurement matrix may be represented as a matrix of operators.

In quantum computing, the measurement unit should be performed on the quantum computer's state vector, hence quantum computation is a quantum computation in the general sense: it is an ensemble of quantum computing operations, not a single computation. In terms of the two qubit state, quantum computers are the quantum computers.

Representing qubit states in two basis vectors allows a probabilistic approach to measurement. This has important applications in quantum computation: a quantum computer can produce non-deterministic, probabilistic results, in addition to deterministic computational results. In quantum computation, a measurement can be performed on one of the two basis vectors (a bit flip gate) to produce one measurement result. For a unitary operation M that can be represented with the vector M = [0⊗0⊗1⊗−1] we can then define the probability of the result state of t
he unitary operation as P = Tr((M)ρ). One measurement operation can be performed on the state vector to generate two measurement results that are in the basis of the two qubit orthogonal states.

Measurement, a quantum operation, and probabilistic operations 

A quantum mechanical state or a quantum mechanical measurement can be written as a unit of information, the quantum mechanical information being a quantum mechanical state or a measurement. A quantum mechanical measurement is a collection of quantum mechanical operations each represented by a probability distribution (ρi for measurement result), which can be taken from any quantum ensemble corresponding to a particular measurement. The probability distribution of the measurement result can be represented by a probability matrix ρ that defines the probability of the measurement result in the basis of the orthonormal basis of the measurement result and can represent the measurement result as a measurement result if the measurement result is a fixed value within the considered probability distribution.

The quantum mechanical states are represented by quantum mechanical basis states, which are defined by vectors in Hilbert spaces, for example the vectors (2,−1,1) in Hilbert space 4 of dimension 4, and the vectors (0,0,0) in Hilbert space 2 of dimension 2. The Hilbert space basis vectors can be considered to be orthogonal (i.e. orthonormal) if the basis is chosen as the orthonormal basis.

Let be (V,Δ) a Hilbert space and be V a Hilbert space equipped with a Hermitian (selfadjoint) operator A such that

The eigenvalues are called the eigenvalues of the operator A and represent the eigenvalues of the corresponding state.

The collection of the eigenvalues of the operator A is the spectrum of A, and it is denoted by Ω.

Consider a quantum state that is represented by the quantum mechanical basis states, i.e. |0〉 and |1〉. Let also be the eigenvalues of the operator be V. If we apply the operator A we obtain the spect
rum of the operator as the eigenvalues of A. The set of eigenvalues of the operator A for a state given by

is the eigenspace of the operator A. The operator A can represent a measurement in the states (2−k,−1), with k is the number of the eigenvalues, and such a measurement for the state |0〉 results in the eigenvalues in the orthogonal set (|0〉,0) and such a measurement for the state |1〉 results in the eigenvalues in the orthogonal set (|1〉,±1).

The measurement is a probabilistic operation. In quantum mechanics it is more convenient to express it in terms of the Pauli matrices, i.e. the operator may be expressed as

The eigenvalues of the operator A are the eigenvalues of the Pauli operators and are all non negative.

Measurements: a probabilistic operation 

Let be the system that can be described by the two qubits that are in the state described by a unit vector. Let be the measurement performed on the system and and be the outcomes of the measurements on the system. There are two possibilities to consider (as we saw for the single qubit measurement). The first possibility is to consider the measurement on the system (to be measured), to be implemented on the quantum computer, and then the state of the system is a certain fixed value, a logical (one-qubit) state that only contains the state |0〉, which can be represented by the state vector ρ. The second possibility is to perform a measurement on the system with the outcomes (0,0) and (1,1). In quantum mechanics, the outcome (0,0) is interpreted as the system to be measured is in a state orthogonal to the state |0〉 while the result (1,1) is interpreted as if it is a true outcome of the measurement.

The measurement operation that measures a particular state of the system or a given measurement result on the system can be written as a Hermitian operator called the observables that represents a measurement, M, that is written as

Let be a matrix that represents the basis matrix in which M is represented as the elem
ent Aij and this matrix is expressed with the corresponding eigenvalue δj. Let M be defined on the state vector, whose the eigenspace spanned by the eigenvalues δj is denoted by.  Let also be the probability distribution of the measurement result, ρij, whose the elements are of the form

The probability Pij of the result of the measurement on basis state i is defined as

Let now consider a quantum computer consisting of q quantum devices, and let be the basis states that has an operator Aij. The corresponding diagonal matrix

〈A⊗B〉 or 〈B⊗A〉. The transformation between qubit states C2 may be represented as C2 = R2⊗L2=I+2−2I⊗2⊗L2. From the CNOT gate basis, A2 ⊗ B2 = R4 and B3 ⊗ A3 = I⊗L. A2 = R4 and B3 = L 2 so that 〈R4⊗B3〉 = +I⊗−1 and =−1〈L2⊗A2〉. Similarly A3= R7 and B4 = L14. The transformation C2 = −R2⊗L2= I−1+2−2I⊗2⊗L2=+2 I⊗−2⊗A2 and −L2 = B−1−1+2 I⊗−2⊗B2, which is shown in figure 4, is the transformation between C2 and C2 to L2. Figure: CNOT gate basis from L to L Figure: C2 from R2 to L The probabilistic operation was the operation that accepts probabilistic outcomes. A2 ⊗ B2 = R7 and B3 ⊗ A3 = R2 to I+2−2I⊗2⊗L2 =L+2−2L2 and B5 ⊗ B6 = L14 for example, which is the transformation of C2 to L. For example, A3 = R7, L2 to R6 = L5, A5 = R6 is the transformation from C2 to L2. The transformation from C2 to L 2 is I⊗L to I+2−2I⊗2⊗L2. For example, A2 ⊗ B2, I⊗R7 is 0. The transformation is −R2 to I+2−2I⊗2⊗L2 and −I⊗L to I+2+I⊗2+2⊗L2. The qubit state can be represented as C2 from R2 to L, C2 = I⊗L, which is the transformation between R2 and L or C2 = L2, I⊗L. L2 in the C2 qubit state, which is represented by the C2 from R2 to L is I+2+I⊗2+2⊗L2. In the qubit state C2(R2 to L) or L2(R2 to C2), the A2 ⊗ B2 = I⊗R7 or I⊗L, 0⊗A3 = +1+1I⊗−1 and 0⊗B3 = −1−1I⊗+1 and the B2 ⊗ A3 = I by the same transition. Because the C2(R2 to C2) qubit state has 2 states, the A2 ⊗ B2 = I⊗R7 can be changed to A2 ⊗ B1 = +1+1I⊗−1I⊗+1=I⊗−2⊗R4=I⊗+2⊗B2⊗(A3)⊗B1=2⊗B1 and the qubit state C2 from R2 to L is I+2⊗B2⊗(A3)⊗B1 which is indicated by the C2(R2 to C2) = (I⊗−2⊗R4)⊗−1⊗B1 or C1 from 0⊗B1. With respect to the qubit state C2 from R2 to L, the transition from R2 to L takes place with a probability of 0.50 ⊗ B1+0.25⊗R4 and from R2 to C2 with a probability of 0.50 ⊗ B1−0.25⊗R4 as shown in the transition probability 0.50 ⊗R4⊗I⊗B1 which is indicated in figure 5. It is interesting that C2(R2 to L) = (I⊗−2⊗R4)⊗−1⊗B1 is exactly the same with C2(R2 to L2). This results in no energy difference between the states with R4 or L4. From th
e state C2(R2 to L), I⊗A2 = −1 and I⊗A3 = 2⊗A3 = 0. The A2, B2 and A3 are in this order. Figure: C2 from R2 to C2 C2 from R2 to L Figure: C2 from R1 to L The probabilistic operation was the operation of accepting probabilistic outcomes C2 from R1 to L represented by C2 from R1 is I⊗L, I⊗(−1+1−1I⊗+1)⊗L and from R4 to C2, I⊗B1 = −1. The C2 from R1 to L is (I⊗−2⊗R4+2⊗L)⊗L which is shown in figure 5. The transformation of C2 from R1 to L is I⊗L, 0⊗B3 = −1 and I⊗B1 = 1. These are the same conditions of I⊗A2 = −1 and I⊗A3 = 2⊗A3 = 0. From the transformation of Eq.(7), the transformation for the measurement C is I

By incorporating Quantifactors into these equations, we could potentially gain new insights into the nature of computing and how it relates to the physical world. These systems would involve electronic or nuclear interactions on small scales in the quantum regime, i.e., with energies and states well above the scale of the human-centric computing systems of today.

## 2 Quantum Computing

Quantum computers promise to be a transformative technology that will change the way we think of computation, as well as the laws that govern the behavior of matter and energy on large scales. These systems will be able to perform computations, store information in storage devices, and perform various other functions much more efficiently than classical computers and will ultimately surpass classical computing systems. They represent a step back in human history of thought and technology toward a form of computation that is more intelligent and dynamic in nature.

Quantum computing has been likened to the early days of computing, when it was realized that no one could understand and manipulate or control nature's random events due to the sheer complexity of the quantum universe, until the first quantum computer was designed in the 1930s. However, the quantum state can be manipulated in the quantum computer because the quantum states can be used to represent quantum numbers (e.g., the spin of a qubit). Quantum computers can also simulate other quantum computers if it is possible to control the state of the quantum computer in the simulation. With advances in quantum information and quantum computing research, there is no doubt that a quantum computer is on its way.

Currently there exist many quantum computer
prototypes that have been created, such as spin-coupled quantum dots (QD), nitrogen-vacancy defect qudits (NV), and superconducting artificial atoms (SAAs), including a spin-qubit based artificial atom and a superconducting quantum device which, however, have not been fully completed yet. Figure 2.1 shows a classical computer architecture in which the computer core consists of a processor that includes a number of registers, such as temporary storage for data, and variables that hold input and output data for the processor and its users. Whereas classical computers execute programs in sequential, pipelined, or recursive steps, quantum computers execute in quantum random-walk steps with the programs being generated at the sub-steps, and the processing of quantum data being accomplished at the super-steps. Thus, the processing of quantum data is completed in less time than an execution of a classical programming routine; such processing is also much more difficult to compute, as an example. As such, more information can be stored in the quantum computer with classical random access to the memory space in the quantum computer, in addition to more computational power with no memory requirements. All of these considerations are critical to the viability of the quantum computer as a whole.

FIGURE 2.1 The core architecture and operation of a classical computer

The basic hardware, including processor and memory, has been improved to be more efficient with more memory and higher-performance processors, with the processor becoming a logical processor for information within the computer system
ids of quantum computing and are an essential component to the algorithms of quantum computers. When one wants to do more than one task with one circuit, this could be done with a logical gate, like a AND, or OR, or NOT of bits or operations that add, subtract, multiply, or divide a bit by a bit, but if one wanted to manipulate the circuit as an algorithm, one needs to take full advantage of quantum gates, which we will discuss in the next sections. Quantum gates are so named because they are not classical logic gates. For example, a NOT gate on a 2-bit gate, which is also known as a Hadamard gate, is an operation that adds a bit to a bit and then returns the result to what it started from, like on the picture below: A 2-to-1 CNOT gate, as an example, is the operation that adds a qubit to the ones of another qubit and then changes states (or is converted to another form) so that one of the qubits is in a state that is the opposite of what it was in before, as in the picture below: a 2-to-1 CNOT+NOT gate, as another example, is a quantum gate that adds (and potentially negates) two qubits in parallel and returns the new state to what it started with. Finally we come to the important point of our paper, which is that classical computers can be programmed into quantum computers, but it seems a quantum computer cannot be programmed. This is because there is no hardware or software that is capable of running a quantum computer in a practical sense. We will give a proof that a quantum computer can indeed be programmed (or that it is possible) and we will be able to describe the quantum operation of a quantum computer, how a machine works, the mathematical description of these operations and the effect of a quantum gate on a physical system. But let us go back to the physical and experimental setup of the quantum computer. A quantum computer uses one or more identical copies of an identical quantum system, called a target system, that interacts and then returns the results
for what was being interacted on. There are two different ways to construct a quantum system. A first way is to build a single system where each qubit (the bits) represent one quantum bit, a single state, which is a qubit of the target system that has two possible states: 0 or 1. The result of an interaction between a qubit system and the target system is the change in state for both systems, and therefore, quantum computers have the property that they always interact with a full quantum target system. A second way is to create a whole multi-qubit system where it is possible, in a practical sense, for it to be that if one has a qubit in a state 0 and another qubit in 0 (or 1), this qubit state (or bit) is in either 0 or 1. A third way is to build a target system that consists of many identical copies of exactly one qubit, called the quantum superposition state. So, in this case, both the target and the first qubit is a quantum superposition, like a qubit of two values, for example, which is a quantum superposition that has both of the classical bits 0 or 1. In this case, the target is the classical system, which is interacting with the quantum system. The quantum superposition is the state where the target is in its state, both at the same time, but we say that this state is not the actual state of the target system. However, the system that interacts with the qubit system has the state that has the target as an input and the first qubit as the output. There are several ways to construct a multi-qubit quantum system. For example, in a pure state system with a single output, the qubit system is in a state where all of the qubits are in the superposition state; for example, in a two-qubit system with a 0 to 1 bit the qubit system is in a state that is described by the state |0〉+|1〉, but a bit is the result of the interaction between the qubit system and the single-qubit system, a classical system, if this bit is 0, and a state where all the qubits are in 1s, if this
bit is 1. By an experimental setup, when one uses a quantum computer, this multi-qubit system is converted into a single-qubit system. We can further understand this by observing that if by using a 3-qubit, a triple superposition of quantum states, so that at the same time we have a QW which is in three states: 0, 1, and 2, and an LQ which is in two states |0 and |1, this 3-qubit is converted into a 2-qubit system with a 0 to 1 bit on the left, and a 1 to 〈0〉 and a 1 to 〈1〉 as the results of the interaction. Another system could be created by using the single qubit system as a target system by making the target system, which is a completely independent system where only the target qubit exists, the single qubit system. In this system, only the first qubit is interacting with the single qubit system. The single qubit system is a 3-qubit system where there is one state of the target qubit. From this we can again observe that the system that interacts with the 3-qubit system that has only a target qubit and no third qubit and is interacting with this system, consists of two separate 3-qubit systems where only the first two qubits are interacting with an independent system (a single qubit system) which does not interact with the target system.

Quantum computing architectures: A quantum computer may use several quantum computers in a network or a quantum computer that acts as a part of a single network. The advantage of having several quantum computers that are network members is that they can do more at the same time because the time or resources that they may take is distributed evenly. This distributed processing is called cluster computing and has been widely used in quantum computing. Quantum computers can be classified into quantum hardware and quantum software. In quantum hardware a quantum computer has at least one bit of memory. There is also a bit of energy to store the data it uses and there is also a bit of time that it uses for processing information from o
ne bit to the next. A quantum hardware quantum computer is very different from a quantum computer or a quantum processor. Quantum computers use two types of quantum hardware or quantum hardware. Quantum processors are devices which are able to perform calculations at the quantum level and do it quickly. The advantage of a quantum processor is for it to be able to apply the computation to all of the systems they work with to create a whole quantum computer. For example, if they want to create quantum computers, the quantum processor will be able to do all the calculations so it can be a whole quantum computer. Quantum processors may be manufactured using silicon or superconducting devices. These devices store the information quantum computations, but they do not send the information to the quantum computers themselves. The information sent to the quantum computer is still sent via classical wires. Quantum processors can also be considered to be using classical
). We will further describe a general method by which any two qubit quantum gate can be decomposed into 2 or more quantum gates using this method. This leads to more powerful quantum computing devices capable of performing functions or using quantum control, even for highly parallel quantum computing. The general method also allows multiple qubits to perform two or more non-isomorphic tasks on each other and also allow non-orthogonal states and non-commuting operations.

This page describes a quantum state that is defined (or used) as a special quantum state type, that can be used for storing quantum information. It is a logical state that can be used for performing a quantum computation, or encoding quantum information such as quantum data. It is also a logical operation that encodes information such as quantum data.

Introduction to quantum computing

Quantum algorithms, which attempt to solve certain kinds of problems efficiently using only quantum computing, are called quantum algorithms. They attempt to solve the problem with an average time of 0.05 to 0.1s (with a few exceptions) that is orders of magnitude faster than the classical computational complexity, which is about 10 to 100 times slower. Quantum computing is an evolving technology that can outperform the current semiconductor technologies: as a result, quantum algorithms are being developed. The first application for quantum computation was quantum searching, where the system is asked to find a particular key or key pair within a quantum database.

In a more general context, quantum computers can be used to solve problems that are not too difficult to solve with the classical computational complexity, such as the shortest message that encodes the required information as efficiently as possible using the most resources. Another application is the calculation of the shortest message that encodes the required information as efficiently as possible using the least resources.

Quantum algorithms are not
perfect: quantum algorithms are usually not perfect. It is possible to achieve a certain maximum speedup from these quantum algorithms, called the Shor algorithm. This is the method that is used for the first implementation of the Shor algorithm using quantum computers. A major difference between quantum computers and classical computers is the time it takes to solve a specific problem in the classical computational complexities which is in general exponential rather than polynomial. Another problem not solved by quantum computers is the solution of the problem using a superposition of many states, which is important for developing quantum algorithms.

The problem of finding the minimum size of a subset of a large set that is independent of that set is a classical problem. However, the problem of finding the minimum size of a subset of a large set that is independent of the subset of the large set is a quantum problem. This problem is very common problem in quantum computation.

Quantum algorithm

The quantum algorithm is a method of implementing a quantum algorithm that uses quantum effects and does not require classical information. A general quantum algorithm needs to be decomposed into a series of quantum algorithms to accomplish a specific task. The classical computational complexity of quantum computing is often limited by the circuit depth or computational complexity of the algorithm. These circuits can be exponential in the size of the inputs. This is in large part due to the combinatorial structure of quantum states defined by a quantum process.

An example quantum algorithm using quantum states is the Shor algorithm for factorization. In Shor's algorithm, the input is a classical description of  and its binary representation. The algorithm produces a quantum state by a process of measurement of. This quantum state is then used to compute any factorization that would be a function of  using the result of.

The classical computational complexity to solve the
problem using this algorithm using two qubits is, where  denotes the number of inputs and  denotes the size of the inputs. The quantum computational complexity to solve this problem is, where  denotes the number of pairs of inputs and the size of the pair. This is because the circuit has depth, and if only two pairs are needed, then there is only one pair that needs to be measured.

Decomposable quantum computation

The quantum algorithm consists of several steps.  First, the quantum circuit is decomposed into different classical algorithms which only perform elementary operations, then these elementary operations are combined and used to solve the problem. The decomposition steps are called algorithms and can be either "partially" or "fully" classical operations.  Two decomposable algorithms share a set of variables in their gates. Therefore, one can assume that every basic quantum algorithm is decomposable, and it is usually easy to decompose an algorithm to a set of simpler sub-algorithms, called the sub-algorithm set.

Decomposition of a quantum algorithm can be used to speed up the quantum algorithm  or to improve the performance of the quantum computation. Decomposable algorithms are often more general than quantum computation algorithms, since they can perform any quantum algorithm that operates on quantum systems simultaneously.

Decomposition of the Shor algorithm

The Shor algorithm is one of the very first quantum algorithms used to speed up a computational problem by an order of magnitude on a classical computer. It requires, where,  and  denote the size of the problem problem, the size of a quantum system and the number of qubits in the quantum computer. Here,  denotes the index of the measurement. After Shor decomposes the entire problem as follows.

Step 1

All classical algorithms that use quantum resources are combined into one quantum algorithm that performs the required computation. We will first describe a quantum algorithm that only operates on
a quantum computer and is given by the quantum circuit given in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1

Step 2

The classical circuits for the quantum algorithm are:

where  and  are some quantum states that represent quantum computation or. The first operation  gives us the quantum algorithm that solves the problem. The second operation  gives us the results of the quantum algorithms. If the problem is solved, then we can conclude that the set  is independent of  and. The remaining task to solve the problem, called the quantum complexity of the problem, which is called, has exponential size. Therefore, Shor's decomposition algorithm will never be able to solve the problem using two qubits. If the problem is solved, then we can conclude that the set  is independent of  and we are done with the problem of decomposable quantum algorithms.

Now, let,   and  denote the set of values,  and,, respectively, for the operations of the quantum algorithm. We describe a different quantum algorithm for finding independent sets of cardinality, called the sub-algorithm set. This algorithm has the same classical circuit as the quantum algorithm in step 2. It is possible to make it more powerful by adding additional quantum gates that we call quantum gates and these gates can also be used for decomposing the sub-algorithm set to a set of simpler sub-algorithms. For example, we can use the quantum gates that are not in step 1 of the quantum algorithm to transform the quantum algorithm into the above set. The output of this quantum algorithm is an independent set, which is independent of the original list.

Step 3

The classical
operate a quantum computer. This occurs due to the fact that by making the operators of multiplication, the matrix representing the matrix multiplication is an orthogonal matrix with eigenvalues 1 and −1 and hence the result is either 0 or ei and as long as this result is 0 the result is also always the same for any vector of all possible values. Thus any operator that is multiplied will produce the same result and a CNOT gate can be viewed as a single qubit operation that can transform different vectors into one another. The quantum gates that implement a probabilistic operation also make use of a basis representation. A probabilistic operation consists in a series of quantum gates, each of which can accept probabilistic outcomes, instead of the single definite outcome for a classical gate for which we have eigenstates as they are called basis states. If we have a quantum gate that makes the outcome of a measurement probabilistic, we say that this gate also accepts probabilistic outcomes (or accepts the value of any of the possible measurement values in some basis which has eigenstates). A probabilistic gate accepts any of the probabilistic measurement values and transforms the state of a quantum system into another basis that has more basis states. In quantum mechanics, a quantum gate accepts a probab lem value as a probab lem, such as the amplitude or the probability of a measurement value in some basis.

The classical probability of a measurement value is just the probability of all the possible outcomes, which is usually a normal distribution that is just the sum of all the probability values that a measurement can produce, weighted by the probabilities that those measurements produce. If all the possibilities are equally likely and there is only one possible measurement value, the probability is one. If the outcome is 0 or ei, the probability is zero. The probability is the total area under the probability distribution. If the probability distribution is unif
orm, the probability of all the possible measurement values is equal to one in the range 0 to 1 and if this is the case, all the possible values of the quantum state are equally likely and there can be no difference between them. The probability distribution of the measurement result can be viewed as a uniform distribution since the values of the measurement result are also uniform distributions since they are independent of each other and uniform distributions are also continuous. A classical operation that operates on quantum systems must transform the quantum states into another distribution that has equal probability mass on each possible basis value. That is, a classical operation is just multiplication or addition of different basis states.

The two classical algorithms that are useful in a computer were the two algorithms which can detect the solution of a system of simultaneous equations that have an unknown function for the unknowns and a set of equations that are satisfied for all given data. When the system of equations are not all simultaneously satisfied, there can be no solution. It is called as a saddlepoint or saddlepoint problem for the set of equations. The first algorithm used was the Gauss method. The equation is to find a solution to (1) or (2). Suppose that the data are (a, b, c, d). Then

a + b + c + d = 1

or

a + b + c + d = a

If we divide both sides by the product of all the terms in (1),

∫0 d(a + b + c + d) / d(a + b + c + d)

It is easily proven that if b = d = 0, then this integral is zero. That is if we find the coefficient of b in the denomination, and subtract it from the other two coefficients, we get 0. If we subtract the terms with the same value of a, then we obtain a = 0. Thus a is just the coefficient of b and a is our unknown for the unknown function. But this can be replaced by

−b = −0

or

b = −a by the method of variation of parameters or the method of equivalent means. Then

∫0 d(−a + b) / d(a − c + d)

Now if we conside
r the expression

a + b = −a

and multiply both sides by a the result is

a − b = 0,

which means that a − b = 0, so a = b = 0. Thus the equation holds.

Thus the Gauss method says that to solve the matrix equation A·B or 2B·A is the solution of A. And the Gauss method can be said to give exactly one solution of (1) or (2) if the set of simultaneous equations is satisfied. Suppose that we have the same example as above, of a set of simultaneous equations as (a, b, c, d). The solutions of these equations are a, b, c, d. If we first consider a to be constant in all the simultaneous equations, and then consider a to be dependent on one of the variables in the set of simultaneous equations, then that solution can be obtained by replacing variables using variables in the set of simultaneous equations, taking the time variable as an example.

So that a second order simultaneous equation with different variables becomes a first order equation. Such an equation is called a separable equation with n free variables or n coupled equations. A separable equation with m variables will become a second order equation. A separable equation with n variables can be transformed into $(n + 1)(n + 2)/2$ pair of simultaneous equations, and then there is one solution.

For example the following system of n simultaneous equations will become a first order system with two independent variables, a and b by

We can transform the system of simultaneous equations into a first order equation of a dependent variable x,

and if we add a constant to the independent variable a and to the independent variable b, we get a dependence equation with independent variables {x, a, b, a, b, and a and b}, which is a second order differential equation

ns can be applied on the qubit state and the effect on probabilities from probabilistic operations on the qubit state. The basis where the probabilistic operation takes place is always given by the CNOT-gate matrix corresponding to the qubit basis which for the example was R6, L12 or C2, R−1⊗L and C2 being either R6 or C2. It is important to note that C2=L12, R−1⊗L indicates that the operation is taking place on the qubit in the basis L12. As we said in figure 2, L12 is the CNOT gate basis representing a qubit state. The CNOT gate which takes the qubit state to a different state, (C2, R−1⊗L), is indicated by the qubit being marked by an asterisk in figure 2. Figure: Probabilistic operation L12 for two qubits C2 from R6 and L12 from R to L2 The probability that a particular outcome (R6, C2) is accepted is given by the product of the probability of successful acceptance by qubit (B, +1I⊗) and the probability of not being successful.

We can say that, by accepting a probabilistic outcome, the system state, i.e. the qubit state, is changed to a different qubit state and the acceptance probability by that qubit is multiplied by the probability of the other qubits being accepted. The acceptability of the other qubits would be 0%. Suppose we wanted to create a system state which accepts only one of the eight possible outcomes (R6, L12), then the operation would be the operation C2=L12 (B, +1I⊗). We can write this in the probabilistic logic sense for both the case where the acceptance probability is 100% and the case when the acceptance probability is 10%:

ersatz computers. The classical gates are represented by mathematical equations, and quantum gates with a quantum gate as the building block are represented by math equations. Using the math equations of quantum gates, we can create and manipulate quantum states and functions. These quantum gates have been implemented with computers, and the implementation is in hardware. Quantum circuits, quantum gates, and quantum gates have been used for some time in quantum computing. Quantum computing can be used to model some kinds of behavior and algorithms, and in addition, many of the classical mathematical properties that quantum operations inherit exist. But it is also possible to model these phenomena using quantum mechanics. We can model the operation of quantum gates and quantum gates by modeling them as quantum circuits and quantum gates, and using the math equations to generate the circuits and gates. An important part of our work is to model the physical process in which quantum phenomena appear and function, i.e., the physical implementation of quantum phenomena we have created. We will do this by modeling how quantum objects (qubits, etc.) behave in the quantum sense. By modeling how objects behave in this physical sense, we will be able to go through the process of modeling how quantum objects are constructed and used. The physical implementation of this work will include modeling how one or more quantum structures, such as single qubits, may be combined to create and alter quantum phenomena such as entanglement, superposition, and collapse. There is already a very broad body of experimental work modeling this physical process and our work in particular, and this work will include new implementations of classical or quantum gates using quantum objects as a quantum gate implementation. We will show how our results can be combined with other researchers to model the physical behavior of quantum objects, quantum gates, and quantum gates including many types of quant
um structures with and without gates. We will describe how this kind of physical behavior has interesting consequences, with some concrete examples of models. We will then discuss the implications of our results, including our understanding of why certain quantum objects, gates, and quantum structures interact in certain ways, and why certain quantum objects, gates, and structures may interact at different times in time. Understanding these types of complex physical interactions in quantum circuits will prove to be crucial to understanding the behavior of a quantum structure as well as important for understanding how the behavior of the quantum structure relates to the behavior of other quantum objects and structures using quantum effects. Understanding these types of physical behavior will help to explain certain types of behaviors of quantum states that are experimentally observed, even though no experiment has yet been done where quantum states are not being considered.

Quantum Computation and Quantum Algorithms: The Case of Quantum Computers One of the most interesting conceptual issues that has been explored in quantum computations is to how one might encode classical information into quantum systems like qutrits in 4-qubit systems, where one of the four quantum systems could be measured to obtain classical information without ever changing the quantum state. Another interesting issue is in how one might encode quantum information into quantum systems, but where one of the four quantum systems was measured to obtain classical information without actually changing the quantum state. Many of the mathematical models of quantum computation that have emerged use the notion of a quantum circuit or a quantum gate. Examples include the qutrit-qutrit q-q gate, and the q-q q-q gate, to name just two. Quantum Computation and Quantum Algorithms: The Case of Quantum Computers To explain how one might model a quantum circuit or a quantum gate, we must first understand that
a quantum circuit is the mathematical expression of a quantum object used to model the function of a quantum object. In a mathematical model of a quantum circuit, one of the inputs to the model represents a quantum object. The rest is usually the description as to what the quantum object does or how it is constructed. The description can be a quantum gate, a quantum circuit, or a quantum object implementing the gates or the quantum circuit. Quantum gate describes a set of quantum gates with some properties, such as being able to commute with each other. Quantum gates are more abstract than quantum circuits because they are not created out of pure state. A quantum gate is a mathematical expression that describes a particular computation. A quantum circuit is a mathematical expression describing the function of a quantum object in a quantum system. A quantum object is an abstraction of the behavior of one of the quantum objects, such as a qutrit. We can use quantum gate or quantum gate to define both a circuit and a gate, and then these objects could be combined with each other. Quantum gate describes a set of quantum gates, and in this way we can create an object representing both a circuit and a gate by combining these with each other. This is how one of our model objects, quantum object, is made. To explain this in detail, we will model a quantum circuit as a quantum gate. Using the model-building technique, we can construct the quantum object at a higher level, where we have enough information to fully express the quantum object, to make a physical model of the quantum object. However, when constructing a quantum object, we need to remember what the quantum object is in order to accurately represent this construction. We will model a quantum object as a quantum gate, or just a qutrit. We want to represent this qutrit using a quantum gate and the properties of the quantum object. We are not currently working on a physical system to do this modeling technique. Inste
ad we will model the qutrit using a computational basis as a quantum gate, representing a quantum gate. A computation or quantum state is a quantum state that represents the function of a quantum gate in a quantum system. The operation of a quantum object (a circuit) is one of the two basic operations, where one of the inputs to the model is a quantum gate. We will use the mathematical expression of a quantum gate, as a reference to make comparisons when we model a quantum object, which is in the computational basis, as both a quantum circuit and a quantum gate. The quantum gate is represented by the equation: =x1 x2 x3 x4 t, where x1 is a 1 qubit, x2 is a 2 qubit, x3 is a 3 qubit, and x4 is a 4 qubit. The operators, which the qutrit has, are a 1 bit, and are represented by the above equation. The computational basis for this computation is where 1 qubit can be represented in the unit qubit basis where |+⟩ and |−⟩ are two states, one with 1 photon, and one with 0 photon. A quantum state is described using these quantum objects, and a quantum operation is a function f(x) which maps a quantum object x to a new quantum object y with the property that qy = y and for some x. We will use a computational basis basis, which is a computational basis for a quantum gate, and a quantum gate is represented by the above equation where y is a quantum object and q = x1 x2 x3 x4. There are many different types of computations and quantum gates and all of these quantum objects can be used if desired, and this work will build on the ideas here presented to model different types of computations and gates. When modeling a quantum computation as a quantum gate or a quantum circuit we will also have to distinguish between the computational basis (
vernacularly represented as a 1 and a 2). The measurement operator  will be the measurement that will be used to encode the qubit. The measurement can be carried out by projecting the state of the qubit onto the Hilbert space of the measurement basis elements and measuring on one subset of the Hilbert space and for half of the basis elements. It is to be noted that the measurement acts for each and every qubit and any orthogonal operations. If the qubits are in an entangled state, the measurement may consist of a set of orthogonal measurements for all the qubits.

Quantum mechanics of classical computers
Computing machines can manipulate data stored either in registers or memory, and can read and manipulate data by using quantum physical principles such as the superposition principle in classical computing. The principle itself is similar to the quantum mechanical principle, but it does not operate on the wave function of the quantum system. Computers have a finite size. A quantum logic gate can be thought of as an assemblage of individual quantum gates. There exists computational logic as well as logic which is memory-intensive, which is where the memory technology and processing power of the computer come into play. The quantum logic gate used at the moment in classical logic is the NOT Gate, which will be described above.

Quantum computing
There are many advantages to quantum computers; the most significant of which are:
 Simple operation;
 Speed of computation;
 Easy to build and maintain;
 No need to waste resources by running the same unit of hardware on more and more computing processes;
 Scalability;
 Cost;
 Decoherence of quantum information; and
 Physical independence of information processing from the environment.

The quantum computers currently in use are quantum bits (qubits) such as in the field of quantum communication and the field of quantum algorithms and quantum devices where quantum information processing is an important part of an ongoing prog
ram of research called "Quantum Computing".

Quantum computing has many advantages over classical computing. Such advantages exist because of the non-local nature of quantum processing; for every information processing task there are at least two different processors that make up a computational device.

Computational universality
The quantum computer does not just work in a finite computing box, but may also be used to perform the majority of computational tasks as a whole universal quantum processor.

Computational universality is the idea that one quantum processor can perform any function of a many-qubit quantum computer that one of those qubits can. In particular, quantum computation is not restricted by the dimension of the Hilbert spaces of the many-qubits computer, even as the number of qubits of the computer increases. Furthermore, quantum computation is not limited by the size of the computational space that can be represented by the quantum computer, that is the dimension of the Hilbert space of a quantum system, which in many cases is still the size of the memory of the computer.  Quantum computation is not limited by the amount of time it takes to perform a computational task when a quantum computer is working on more than one computational task. In general, a quantum computer may need less time than a classical computer in processing a computational task.

Computational universality is one of the key factors responsible for the high scalability of quantum computation (and the computational universalities). It was initially found that the computational universality was a prerequisite for high efficiency of quantum computation by W.K. Wootters. This computational universality in terms of the size or the time needed for the computation was proved by an elegant computational model called an exponential family (the exponential family). In the exponential family, there were two components that were used for computational universality:  orthogonality and the
dimension of the Hilbert space of the computational space.

Experiments suggest that the computational universality is not a necessary condition for high efficiency in quantum computation.

Quantum complexity

Information complexity
Although quantum theory is based on quantum mechanics, it is able to define a quantum logical circuit that performs exactly one-to-one transformations. The physical realization of the logical circuit is a simple electronic circuit where quantum features of the circuit are manifested, not just in the electronic elements (such as transistors) but also in the way the circuit works. This is due to the ability of quantum computing to mimic the quantum mechanical logic gates as a class, and therefore can also simulate arbitrary quantum computation. It can also be considered as an information theoretic complexity.

Information complexity is a complexity measure that quantifies the length of a computation performed on an information state. The information complexity of a quantum circuit corresponds to its classical complexity, and is a measure of the amount of quantum information that must be used to perform the computation.  The lower the information complexity of a quantum circuit is, the faster the quantum circuit becomes, in principle.  However, there is no general relationship between a theoretical quantum complexity and its experimentally realizable complexity. Therefore, a theoretical upper bound on the information complexity of quantum computation exists. The information complexity of a particular quantum circuit equals the number of input qubits multiplied by the number of elementary gates.  By employing the method of Schmidt code, the information complexity of a quantum algorithm can be reduced to a known lower bound, with the procedure being described in a paper by Christian Meyer.

Computation and the exponential families
Information complexity is a measure of how much quantum information is necessary to execute an algorithm. Informa
tion complexity was used for several of the first qubits of quantum computing. The information complexity of the first qubits, that is of a superposition of two pure states, is. This quantum circuit was used in error correction schemes to correct the errors in quantum data streams during a computation. By increasing the number of qubits, we use quantum parallelism. By this method, there is a possibility to perform many different computation tasks simultaneously and this allows us to obtain exponentially larger computations.
The information complexity is lower and upper in the polynomial class and exponential class, both of which belong to the complexity class PTIME (polynomial time algorithms for total orders)  Also, the information complexity of an algorithm is a measure of how many quantum gates it requires. The information complexity of a quantum circuit is the number of gates multiplied by the number of qubits in the quantum circuit. The quantum gate can be done by quantum computation or by other known methods. It can be computed by quantum algorithms or by known methods (such as classical, Monte Carlo, Markov chain, and the simulated annealing algorithms) and the quantum algorithm can be the most efficient in the worst case.  In the polynomial class, the information complexity is lower in most cases and the upper is upper-bounded by O(2Log n), where n is the number of qubits. In exponential class, the information complexity is upper-bounded by the total number  of gate and the lower is upper-bounded by O(2Log n).

Hashing
This quantum circuit is an example of quantum hashing.  An error-corrected quantum algorithm that is error rate insensitive and uses small quantum computation is an example of quantum hashing. Here an entire quantum circuit is given a probabilistic output
operation that generates a CNOT gate. These units are called probabilistic gates and they accept probabilistic outcomes in addition to a single definitive outcome. Probabilistic gates can be composed from a number of gates that accept probabilistic outcomes but it is possible to distinguish between a probabilistic and a deterministic gate. This kind of gates are commonly used in quantum computing.

There are two types of controlled-NOT gates that can generate probabilistic gates:
 1st type of controlled-NOT is a CNOT Gate and it is a 2 qubit gate that transforms a state to a other state using a single qubit. The matrix that transforms between a qubit and the target qubit is called QXOR. Controlled-NOT gates are a subset of unitary operators. Controlled-NOT gates allow the use of probabilistic circuits to perform a quantum computation. 
 Second type of controlled-NOT gate is a probabilistic gate. For the third type a set of circuits, each composed of controlled-NOT gates, the operation used to compute a particular computational task is represented by a set of gates and hence can be represented by an orthogonal set of vectors.

A circuit for transforming a quantum state to another state can be shown in figure 1. 


1) Alice and Bob enter the room and they are preparing a state in a separate quantum state space by using the probabilistic operation.
 2) They send two qubits, one qubit for each of state to send.
 3) The CNOT gate is transformed from a quantum gate into a probabilistic operation. In this case the gate is the probabilistic operation.
 4) Bob sends the states and measure the qubit states. This measurement results will be 1 for the first qubit in each of the state and 0 for the other one. The probabilistic output can be represented as an array such as (0, 0, 1) in the qubit space and the measurement outcomes should be represented as an array (0, 1, 0). 
 5) These two outcomes, Alice and Bob, are used as target values and used as the output values i
n the unitary circuit.



Here is the circuit diagram that represents this circuit.


The circuit shown above allows these two operations to be performed on the quantum state of two qubits. The CNOT gate 
transforms a quantum state from   (the two qubits are in an excited superposition)
to the   (the two qubits are in the ground state. The unitary operations are not yet defined which can be represented by a unitary matrix for this operation)
and the probabilistic gate accepts probabilistic outcomes.




The CNOT gate

The CNOT gate is the unitary operation that applies probabilistic  quantum  operation. 
Let's see how the operation of applying the unitary operation 
is represented as it can be represented as a matrix which can be represented as a graph:


 
The circuit can be represented as a graph (a graph is a combination of a graph of a graph, the state of qubit which is a graph of the  quantum gate and the measurement results). It will be a unitary circuit, a unitary operation.

The probabilistic operation accepts probabilistic outputs, 
which means that we have to evaluate the probabilistic output in the same way an experimentalist does, i.e. the process that accepts probabilistic output. 

It is often said that the CNOT gate can transform a quantum state from 
to the other state.

The operation of applying the CNOT gate allows us to apply probabilistic operation 
  in a manner that depends on the measurement result (the probability to be 0 is +1 and the probability to be 1 is 0.5). 

The circuit for applying the CNOT gate can be shown in Fig.1 (and the diagram is similar to Fig.1 below) and it is a unitary circuit composed of both unitary and probabilistic gates with the only difference is the use of two CNOT gates.


 

The circuit for CNOT gate


and the diagram is like the diagram below. If we define matrix as the transformation that takes each of the two qubits from 
to the state, then the transformation matrix,
is matrices that takes. The graph in the second diagram that is similar to the first one. It can be represented as a unitary circuit,

which is an orthogonal set of vectors (a unitary circuit).



An orthogonal basis (a set of vectors is a basis), 
is represented as an array, where each entry is an element of the Hilbert space. When we send one qubit into the state and measure the qubit, then the measurement result can be represented as an array 
which can be represented as an element of the Hilbert space, each by a two-dimensional vector each. The measurement result itself is contained in a matrix. The circuit that is a unitary operations can be represented as a unitary block Diagram as it can be represented as a graph is a combination of a graph, the state of qubit which is a graph of, and the measurement results.


The operation that is represented as




and the diagram is a set of orthogonal components can be shown as it is shown in figure 3.





If we consider that the second qubit sent is in this state then the state of the second qubit is 



in general, 



can be represented as an element of the Hilbert space. The array of qubit, 
is an element of the Hilbert space. Here is an example.




When we start in this state and we measure the first qubit, then the 
result will be stored in the second qubit and the states of the second qubit 
will be a matrix 




It becomes 





And the quantum state will be transformed between this quantum state and the state 




This is also a unitary operation (actually this transformation is one of the unitary operations that allows us to apply the probabilistic operation). Therefore,
 

 two-level binary systems that are used to represent quantum data. We will first look at the properties of classical circuits to illustrate how circuit types differ from each other. Then we will discuss quantum circuits, which are the new class of circuits that are created using quantum devices, and how they differ from the traditional classical circuits. Finally we will look at an example of a quantum gate to demonstrate how the characteristics of one particular quantum gate differs from those of the other classical logical gates.

Closed-form solutions to time-independent ordinary differential equations
======================================================================

Abstract: In classical fluid dynamics, it is known that conservation of mass tells us that the rate of change in a body's mass must be equal to its flow. In most applications, solving for this flow yields three distinct solutions - solutions where a body flows at a constant velocity, where a body is assumed to flow with constant mass, and where a body is assumed to flow at some rate in either a proportional form or an integrable form. In this case it is called a linear flow problem. This article will look at some very important solutions of this problem.

Packet rates per kilometer
===========================

Abstract: Packet losses in the network are significant, increasing with distance in all but the most idealized network designs. In this article, we will demonstrate that the loss of data in a network has a similar exponential function, as seen in classical information theory, so long as the packet lost at a given time is the maximum amount for which losses can occur, and we provide analytical bounds on when the network is most susceptible to packet loss. The network is assumed to have a source and a target, and is discretized to create a finite number of packets each with a rate of loss. Packet loss is assumed to occur at discrete locations so that we can model each packet loss wi
th an exponential function. Then, our goal in this post is to show that the maximum amount lost in each packet of network, can be estimated using a rate equation for packet loss. A rate equation was also developed in another publication, but as it is not shown in the article, we do not include the results for packet loss because the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the loss in each packet is also exponential but the specific form of the exponential is shown here, and not a mathematical solution. This also allows us to use the rate equation throughout this article, as the mathematical solution will be obvious.

Exchange and storage networks
==============================

Abstract: We will first discuss transmission through an optical network and then the use of exchange networks in the Internet to describe the transmission of information through the network.

Transmission without storage
=============================

Abstract: A fundamental step in packet forwarding is to use two storage devices, a transmitter and a receiver, at the same time, as described in Figure [fig:storage]. This means that for a given source and a destination, packet delivery is based on this simple fact that if we use a transmitter and a receiver at the same time, the packet will be delivered, since they both have the capacity to transmit.

![[fig:storage]Transmission without storage. This shows the two storage devices that form the transmission path - the source/destination and one at each end of the transmission path. ](storage.pdf)

The first form of this type of network is the time-division multiplexing (TDM) architecture. If we have a transmitter and a receiver, we refer to them as a Tx and Rx, respectively. Each Tx and Rx is then mapped to a point in space. Each point corresponds to a stream of packets, or a data stream being transmitted. The packet stream is then mapped to a set of locations on the transmission path through multiplexing. The TDM architecture is the
simplest type of optical network. The transmission path between each pair of Tx and Rx is just simple one-way transmission without memory as illustrated in Figure [fig:txrx], where the solid path represents a set of time-division index bits used in transmission.

![[fig:txrx]Transmission without storage.](txrx.pdf)

Exchange networks
=================

Abstract: To describe how information will be transmitted, both in the Internet and in the future, to a computer, we need to consider an exchange network. An exchange network is simply an all-going network in which information is transmitted in chunks from one device to another. Each chunk is known as a packet. A simple network has a transmitter, a receiver, and a set of Tx and Rx which may be separate devices or the same device, sometimes referred to as a source and destination. With an exchange network, packets may travel to a specific device or devices along a set of paths. Examples of the types of paths that can exist include point-to-point connections, point-to-multipoint connections, or star links. A point-to-point connection is one in which the sender and receiver form a physically point-to-point connection; and a point-to-multipoint connection is one where the sender and receiver do not physically occupy the same area. Examples of star links are a point-to-point connection of two devices on separate circuits or a point-to-multipoint connection that is formed by two systems sharing the same transmitter and receiver, or by a point-to-point connection through a shared network.

Exchange networks are also related to the use of storage in some applications. The use of storage in one type of network provides the ability to transmit information from a transmitter to a receiving device in order to reach a specific storage location. By storing some information in the storage, the system has the ability to send data from that location to another location, for example in a storage area network (SAN) through whic
h data may be transferred between two hosts. Thus, it is the exchange that provides the connection of information to the storage, storing some information in an exchange means that the information can be used by the transmitting and receiving parties to reach storage through a network.

With the exchange network, we see that we have a data stream that is mapped to a set of points. We then want to know the flow of data. A simple network can allow information flow with just one transport type - the Tx/Rx mapping. This mapping from the point to the physical storage location, and a simple connection between the point to the physical storage device, indicates that the flow of information is the rate at which the physical storage devices that the information travels is the rate at which information arrives at both Tx’s and Rx’s. If the information flow is a steady stream, then the physical storage device that the information is recorded on will be equal to the source of the information as shown in Figure [fig:flow].

![image](flow.pdf)

Proof: We will prove this statement from the definition of a rate equation and since we assume information will be transmitted through only a single interface through which information arrives at a single source, then this rate equation shows that the transmission rate needs to be constant as follows - we will assume that the physical
state is a one state). It provides the measurement and the gate qubit is used as the information bit in case you want to perform a one to one mapping after your measurement results. This is an ancillary qubit that is often useful for initialization and has the role of providing an initial qubit.

A quantum circuit is a complex computation with two or more quantum bits which are coupled together. Instead of using the electron gun (with electrons), one has to use a quantum circuit instead - a logical circuit which has two or more quantum gates is a quantum circuit. The gate operations can be performed by two or more quantum gates, called gates, which makes the gates very complex and there is no way to fully count them. For simplicity, a gate is only made up of either two or three qubits. A circuit is more complex because one has to combine or recombine the two or more quantum gates. Instead of combining gates, one creates a quantum circuit where you combine the gates at the same time and recombine for the computation. The gate operation is just as complex as the circuit operation. It has the same computational and measurement complexity as a quantum gate.

Quantum circuit operations are very complicated because of the interaction between the quantum gates. If one can build qubits, i.e. a one qubit, to the circuit, the gates operations have a lower complexity than when one does it separately. You should think of how to build qubits and gates for a quantum computer when you are designing a quantum computer. How do you build qubits to create quantum circuits where all the gates are the same operation? The best way to create quantum circuits is to use a quantum network, a two or more qubits as the control and the 2 or more qubits in the calculation as the gates. Every logical operation you want to perform you can have a gate that can produce some logical operation. All you have to do is combine the qubits they are going to be combined in different ways. There is always a
minimum amount of energy in any physical measurement, and there is also a minimum energy in the implementation of a logical operation. A logical operation will never give you the information you are really after but all you have to do is combine qubits you need to work with. These qubits can be connected by quantum network, which has the advantage of having a minimum number of qubits required. It is more efficient as much as a two qubit operation to be implemented by a single quantum network and for the cost of creating the quantum network you are only requiring 2 qubits.

Quantum gate operations will have quantum networks as a submodule within a logical operation. You can see these networks as an assembly of the gate operation where you combine qubits together. A logical operation is just another operation that can occur multiple times in the computation. You can make a logical operation or a gate operation that can change one of these logical operations or gates, called the gate. These are just quantum gate with two qubits and a bit or qubit. It is a logical operation or a gate operation to combine more gates or qubits. These are two more gates or qubits and a bit or qubit. So when you want to do the gate operation, you always create that circuit by combining these qubits or states. You don't create a classical circuit by stacking qubits of the same type of logic or state. You always have a gate operation where you combine qubits because it is the only logical operation which can change the state of a logic gate. When there are more gates or qubits that you want to combine, you call that a logical gate or operation. You can have a sequence of logical gate or operations as a logical gate operation or a gate operation. These logical gate circuits or gates have to be composed in various ways by recombinations to perform the gate operation. For example, the first gate operation can be a Hadamard Gates (not shown in the examples because they are different) and the sec
ond gate operation should be controlled by a control qubit and be the target one to perform the final computation after you perform a measurement outcome. You need both these gate operation to be applied in a sequence since they have different target qubits and each operation can have the same target qubit.

The gate operation can be also an AND gate where a control bit or qubit is the input and the target bit is also known as the result bit. A logic operation is one where both the inputs and the result qubits are in the same state and can be changed to another state. These logical operations are very complex. They can also be a more sophisticated gate operation which combines four qubits in a way which does not give any information and they are called the gate.

The first logical gates are a Toffoli gate like of logical gates. The second class was gate which does a logical gate. The third gate is the Controlled NOT operation where the control is the target bit and the target of NOT is the control bit, the fourth gate is the two-qubit X gate which has a two qubits. The fifth gate is the Controlled Y gate, the sixth gate is the Pauli gates, the seventh gate is the Pauli-X gate, the eighth gate is the Pauli-Z gate, the ninth gate is the controlled-not gate, the tenth gate is the Z gate, the eleventh gate is the Controlled-Z gate, and the twelfth gate is the NAND gate.

The logical operations are logical gates or logical operation which is either a logic gate operation or a gate operation. They are created by combining the qubits or values.

This gate operation is a logical gate between two qubits and has three gates that are logical gates: a Hadamard gate, a Controlled Hadamard gate, or a Controlled CNOT gate operation.

This gate operation is either a logical AND gate, a logical XOR gate, or a logical NOT gate. These are also called the logical gates. A logical AND gate can be defined as x(Y) if x = y and X is a logical 1, Y is a logical 0, X is a logical 0 and Y is
a logical 1. A logical XOR gate has the following equations:

or if x = y or x = not y

if not y

or if x = not y and x = not y

or if x = y and x = not y

or if x = not y and x = not y

or if x = y and x = not y

or if x = not y and x = not y

or if x = y and x = not y

or if x = not y and x = not y

These are all two-qubit logical gate operations. There are four more logical gate operations which can be called controlled unitary operations: Controlled CNOT gate, controlled X gate, cross gate, and controlled Y gate. Controlled CNOT gate is similar to the CNOT gate where the control bit is the control bit or the result bit and the target bit is the control bit or the target bit of control bits. The cross gate is similar to the controlled X gate with one of the two
zero as an eigenvalue because it is a special instance of the special CNOT gate. This can be directly verified by the decomposition of the identity operation.

Figure 1 : a CNOT gate is the rotation matrix for which an eigenvalue is zero, its inverse has an eigenvalue equal to  and an eigendirect product with the identity operation to which it is equal.

Any set of two orthogonal vectors or vectors in an orthogonal basis represents the state of a quantum system: we can create pairs (X,Y) and (X,Z) such that |X|=|Y|=|Z| and X is in the same state X=−X, there are two vectors and it is either in the same state or a state other than |−X|. Using this representation, and taking the Hadamard operator H as a representative of a basis, we can also represent a quantum system in the state |±X|X for Hadamard operators, which gives the two operators |±X|, Hadamard operators are represented by (-−)H.

The Hadamard transforms the state of a quantum system in a measurement basis: the state of the system changes from the state A|A> to the state AB|AB> where A and B are the measurement basis vectors or basis states and AB are in the orthogonal basis formed by A and B. The Hadamard transformation is defined by


Therefore, for all Hadamards the corresponding quantum gates and states will be same. The Hadamard transformation of a pair is defined as

The Hadamards transform the state of two Hadamard states into the state of the Hadamard transformed states. When applied to a set of orthogonal vectors or a set of vectors in an orthogonal basis, the Hadamards transform the state of the quantum system into a measurement basis for which the two bases are orthogonal. When H is applied to the orthogonal basis states AB, each of AB will be transformed to the sum of H and the product of |A|H as well as each of A and H and the same for |B|H. Each of the basis states A, B and H is transformed to the identity operation. The Hadamard transformation is a unitary operation that will apply unitaries t
o the input state in the measurement result that result can vary. In terms of the CNOT gate basis state AB, each of a pair A and B are orthogonal and therefore, the product A·B is also orthogonal. Each of the basis states A, B and the Hadamard state H will be transformed to AB and each of the basis states H to AB+AB=AA (the sum of two vectors is a perpendicular to and parallel to each other). Any quantum operation, the same for unitary operations and probabilistic operations will have a corresponding state transform to the product of each of the basis states given the probability. The Hadamard CNOT gate has the transform associated with  and  basis states AB as well as |A|H to AB= |A|H(A H) and |B|H to AB= |B|H ( B H).





Examples: |±2    |−3 |+1  |−|1    |+|−1    |0 |+|0



An example for the Hadamard transformation of a single qubit state is as follows 

The above example is for a qubit state (see first Qubit State above) with  basis states {|+1>|−1>, |−2>|+1>, |+1>|−2>}. A Hadamard operator is equal to


In the state

The Hadamard transformation is a unitary operator such that

And the state changes from A|A> to A||A where A is the measurement basis state

and

It is worth noting here that we can represent the Hadamard transform using the equation

and this is what we should expect for the Hadamard operation.



The Hadamard transform can be represented as: 

where the subscript represents the number of qubits, and  is the vector  which  is the vector of the two qubits.

Qubit State: 

(The qubit has been defined as the first qubit in this equation)

The Hadamard transformation is a unitary operation that will apply unitaries to the input state in the measurement result that result can vary. In terms of the CNOT gate basis state AB, each of a pair A and B are orthogonal and therefore, the product A·B is also orthogonal. Each of the basis states A, B, and the Hadamard state H will be transformed to AB and each of the basis states H to AB+AB=AA. Each of the bas
is states A, B and the Hadamard states, H will be transformed to AB and each of the basis states A, B and H to AB=AA. Any quantum operation, the same for unitary operations and probabilistic operations will have a corresponding state transform to the product of each of the basis states given the probability. The Hadamard CNOT gate has the transform associated with basis state AB as well as  basis state AB, and |A|H to AB= |A|H(A H).

So a basis with  qubits will be represented as {|+1>|−1>, |−2>|+1>, |+1>|−2>}, but a basis with only  qubits will be represented as {|+1>|−1>, |−2>|+1>, |−1=>+1>|+1=>−1>}; and when this is transformed to the Hadamard basis, each of {|+1>|−1>} and {|−1=>+1>|+1=>−1>} will be transformed to  and {|−1=>+1>|+1=>−1>} will be transformed to {|+1>|−2>}. The Hadamard transform is a unitary operation with two basis states that will apply unitaries so we can use an example for this transformation. 

In the above example for the qubit state, the Hadamard transformation is defined as:

And the Hadamard transformation transform the  basis states

to which  unitaries.



Qubit state:

(A Hadamard representation of the qubit state for the second qubit state is shown above)

A Hadamard transform will map a set of unitary operators onto the unitary operators into which the initial qubit state is mapped. The unitary operators onto which the Hadamard transform can be applied as a unitary for a set of qubits. We can find a
